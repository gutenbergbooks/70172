		<small>A GAME THAT ENDS BADLY.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>“Bravo, Sidonie!”</p>

<p>“Ah, but he escapes her, the scamp!”</p>

<p>Thus shout the spectators as they watch a poor young
lame girl chase, with all her energy, a young fellow of
two and twenty, who makes all possible effort to elude
her.</p>

<p>Sidonie’s right hand clasps an important adjunct of
the homely game—a little cluster of red raspberries. In
the absorbed ardor of pursuit the “Little Crook,” as
they call her, holds it quite mechanically, and from her
tightly clinched fingers trickle drops of the crimson
juice as she runs.</p>

<p>“Good, little one, good,” cries the little old man, who
is highly amused at the endeavors of the unfortunate
lame girl.</p>

<p>Sidonie makes a fresh start—this time determined to
catch the fugitive. The aspect of the afflicted girl as
she hobbles about on limbs of unequal length does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Page 4]</span>
engender among these peasants any particular feeling
of compassion. None of her companions ever dreamed
of offering her pity. She perfectly enjoys the game.
She would be utterly astounded and piqued if any one
manifested an open sympathy on account of her deformity.
With that great endurance so natural among
hardy peasants, and often so inexplicable to the city born
and bred, she pursues the young man. After running
in a straight line a short distance, he suddenly changes
his tactics. A tree—several for that matter, but one in
particular—stands near by. He runs behind it and awaits
Sidonie, his hands clasping the trunk. Reaching the
tree she fully expects to seize him. But he pretends
to go to the right, and as she confidently advances he
makes for another tree to the left, and so the game is
prolonged. And the brave girl, always smiling, continues
the pursuit, until at length Bruno, the young
peasant, slips and falls upon the sward, and before he can
recover himself, Sidonie holds him down and daubs his
face over and over again with the juice of her crushed
raspberries.</p>

<p>Everybody approaches to congratulate “Little Crook,”
who laughs in glee at her triumph. Her good-natured
adversary joins in the ensuing merriment.</p>

<p>What game are they playing? Indeed, it has no
name as yet, for it has just been invented by Catherine,
the wife of Madame le Hausseur’s gamekeeper;
but its novelty has rendered it at once popular among
the country lads and lasses.</p>

<p>The game continues for perhaps an hour, and more
than one pretty face is smeared with the bright red
juice. If a kiss is taken now and then, who complains
of that? Surely not the lovely Catherine, who, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Page 5]</span>
married to the gamekeeper, is not averse to a friendly
caress. In truth, it is oftenest after her that the young
men give chase—she is so gay, so bright, so little scandalized
by the familiarities of her young adorers. Presently
her turn comes to play the pursuer’s <i>rôle</i>. She
selects Bruno as her victim. Graceful, Diana-like in
form, and charming in her abandon, she bounds through
the bushes.</p>

<p>In the background of this living picture stand the
great trees—chiefly beeches and oaks—as erect as proud
sentinels, their wide-spread branches forming a grateful
shade where the peasants are sitting in sociable groups.
In the clearing, just in front of the older people, who are
watching with enjoyment the sport of the younger ones,
is a dense mass of raspberry bushes that are fairly loaded
down with ripe fruit. Never before have raspberries
been so abundant in this locality. Under a tree are
ranged all sizes and kinds of baskets. Soon in the
hot July sunshine old and young will begin to gather
this wild crop, which may be had for the picking. Some
have come solely for the purpose of improving each
shining hour of this Sunday morning in obtaining as
much of the fruit as possible. Others think a little
diversion is not out of order on such an occasion. And
so the impromptu game proposed by the vivacious wife
of the gamekeeper has been eagerly approved by a
dozen or more participants.</p>

<p>Bruno now runs breathlessly after Catherine, but she is
too fleet of foot to be caught. Animated and happy,
the gamekeeper’s wife is wholly absorbed in the sport,
and triumphs because she is able to distance her pursuer.</p>

<p>At length, a towering, broad-shouldered fellow, with a
confident air, is seen coming along the footpath. By<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Page 6]</span>
his side walks a queer little being, with uneven steps,
misshapen body, short, twisted legs, and enormous arms.
Both stop to watch the game—the first like a man who
cannot be induced to enter into any such frivolous pastime;
the other like a man incapable of doing so by
reason of his poor physique.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Andoche,” salutes Catherine as she
passes the deformed little man, who smiles with a wry,
disagreeable face.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Madame Catherine,” he returns,
with a look of malice in his eyes. Then turning to the
other he remarks, “You will see how she will manage
to invite you to join in.”</p>

<p>Bruno, running at a swift pace, passes before the newcomers.
The young woman, making a sudden <i>detour</i>,
again approaches them, and asks in a voice of admirable
nonchalance:</p>

<p>“Would you not like to play for a while, Monsieur
Firmin?”</p>

<p>“Ah, what did I tell you?” exclaims Andoche, bursting
into laughter.</p>

<p>“Will you be one of us?” continues the young
woman.</p>

<p>“I do not know the game, but I will play,” responds
Firmin.</p>

<p>Catherine, by an adroit manœuvre, leads the waiting
Bruno to one side and smilingly makes him a sign. He
throws himself upon Firmin and besmears his face with
berry juice. Firmin’s surprise quickly curdles into
anger. Like a giant he resents the treatment, but it is
quite unnecessary for him to give poor Bruno such a
resistless blow. Advancing to interpose hasten Rosalie,
Félicité, Suzanne, Justine, Nicholas, Mathieu, Constant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Page 7]</span>
and others. Firmin has not time to give a second
blow. He strikes out only once, but that is quite sufficient.</p>

<p>Catherine briefly explains the nature of the game.
During her explanation the jeering Andoche regards
her insolently, and when she has finished he observes:
“It is not a proper or neat game for Sunday,
when one is quite clean and fresh.”</p>

<p>“And now,” continues Catherine, coolly, paying no
heed to the sneer of Andoche, “it is your turn to run
after some one, and decorate her face if you catch her.”</p>

<p>“I will, then, run after you,” declares this young Antinous,
rather stupidly.</p>

<p>“How foolish!” exclaims the disagreeable Andoche.
“If you expect to catch Madame Catherine, you will
have to double your speed.”</p>

<p>Firmin does not notice the evil slur in the old man’s
suggestion. As soon as he dashes forth, all seek to
evade him.</p>

<p>Catherine, blushing a little in spite of herself, leaves
the open glade and gains the forest. In two or three
long strides Firmin might overtake her, but she is too
quick for him, because she darts first to the right and
then to the left so skilfully that the great fellow, each
time going as straight as an arrow, overleaps her by
several feet and so loses her, much to the amusement
of the others.</p>

<p>“What a goose!” grumbles that beast of an Andoche.
“She will lead as far as you care to follow her.”</p>

<p>Though the beautiful Catherine is evidently fatigued,
Firmin cannot catch her. Now she disappears from
view behind the raspberry hedges, some minutes perhaps
elapsing before she and her pursuer are again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Page 8]</span>
seen. Sometimes the gamekeeper’s wife reappears
with a little grimace on her face, for the game begins
to pall. The cries of enthusiasm cease.</p>

<p>But Catherine remains indefatigable. Old Andoche
continues to jeer, and finally in his garrulous, cynical
voice cries: “How interesting it would be should Monsieur
Barrau happen to pass this way! He might not
be altogether pleased at the sight.”</p>

<p>Scarcely has Andoche finished speaking when through
the trees they see the gleam of a musket. The branches
are pushed aside, and a man clad in velvet, with long
gaiters extending from his knees, makes his appearance,
followed by a dog which as he bounds to and fro barks
joyously.</p>

		CHAPTER II.<br>
		<small>THE ALTERCATION.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Savin Barrau was naturally a soldier. As Catherine
was a beautiful woman, so was Savin a distinguished-looking
man. His regular-featured face wore an expression
of hauteur and valor, as though he often had
stood in the face of death. But upon his lips one could
have fancied there lurked a smile both touching and
tender. His handsome dark eyes brightened his face to
an extraordinary degree. Brave and noble he seemed
as he stood gazing upon the scene.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha,” said the vindictive Andoche, “I have
brought trouble to our charming Madame Catherine
with my remarks, I fear. Another time I shall hold my
tongue.”</p>

<p>Savin approached, carrying his gun in his left hand.
His dog Patachaud was still bounding at his side. A
feeling of restlessness possessed the crowd, hitherto so
joyous. A jealous glitter suddenly came into Barrau’s
eyes. He could not disguise his disapproval of his
wife’s frivolity.</p>

<p>Every one thought Catherine would discontinue the
game and run to meet him. But no. Either bravado
or the testy consciousness of her virtue led her to continue
it. Firmin, who as yet had not perceived Barrau,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Page 10]</span>
darted after her with increased zest. The gamekeeper
came forward with even tread.</p>

<p>“Ah, some game seems to be in progress,” said he as
he halted.</p>

<p>His wife and Firmin now disappeared from view. A
look of displeasure clouded Savin’s features. With a
military gesture he rested his hand on his knee. The
dog continuing to leap upon him, he shouted: “Down,
Patachaud, down, sir!” a little rudely.</p>

<p>A profound silence enveloped the scene. Every one
was impressed, for all knew the keeper’s mood. Why
indeed should the coquettish Catherine so vex her brave
husband? Presently she again came in sight. Merrily
she went toward Savin, smiled up at him, and seizing
his shoulders swung around him, without a thought of
abandoning the game.</p>

<p>Certainly Savin’s look of displeasure should have
warned her to desist, but that look she obstinately refused
to see. Fortified by her husband’s tall figure,
Catherine stood panting and laughing, while Firmin
foolishly advanced toward her in pursuit.</p>

<p>At this juncture, the gamekeeper, impatiently tapping
the ground with his foot, exclaimed: “Come, come!
this is a little too bold.”</p>

<p>“Now for a storm,” murmured Andoche. “Firmin
would have passed the time better by drinking a couple
of glasses of beer with me.”</p>

<p>Firmin stupidly stared at Barrau, with an air of indifference;
while Catherine, vexed at Savin’s interference,
addressed him brusquely in these words: “Well, what
are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Not much. You have played too long. You must
go and rest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Page 11]</span></p>

<p>“But we have not yet gathered the berries.”</p>

<p>“Well, let the others do that. Come, let us go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed,” said Catherine, perversely. “You
may go on if you like, but I——”</p>

<p>“Come along, Catherine. Do not provoke me.”</p>

<p>A hard look entered her eyes. To be led away before
everybody appeared to her, at that moment, the
acme of humiliation. It was wiser to concede to her
husband’s wishes, she well knew, for he loved her ardently,
and had only her welfare at heart. But she did
not wish to seem so meek before her friends. Indeed,
she would show them that she was not to be bullied.</p>

<p>“It would have been surprising had you not come to
spoil all our sport. But, as I said before, you may go.
I shall remain longer.”</p>

<p>“Poor little one,” said Andoche, hatefully.</p>

<p>The gamekeeper’s wife turned toward a group of
peasants, some of whom were regarding her approvingly,
others with displeasure.</p>

<p>“Catherine,” said Barrau, in vibrating tones, “I am
the master, you understand, and never shall I submit to
being laughed at by a Firmin.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! You always see evil in everything. Am I
doing wrong? Whenever I try to enjoy myself you are
angry. In order to please you, I ought always to stay
at home. But I don’t care for that sort of life—not I.”</p>

<p>“Come!”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Savin was visibly disturbed. His resolute face looked
pained. He said nothing, but going straight up to
his wife, he took her by the arm and forced her to go
by his side. Vexed with rage, she attempted to free
herself, but in vain. Her husband held her closely.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Page 12]</span>
But rather than go with him she fell to the ground,
sobbing.</p>

<p>“Catherine, my girl, come,” urged Savin, more gently.
“Do not be a baby; come willingly. People are
mocking at us.”</p>

<p>Did the young woman believe her husband would
weaken? Or did she think it dramatic to make a
scene? Who knows? At all events, she raised her
hand to strike her husband on the face, when he, foreseeing
the intention, arrested the blow. His movement
was so rapid that he did not realize what strength he
exerted in seizing her fingers. Held as firmly as though
she were in a vice, Catherine uttered a little cry of
pain.</p>

<p>“You hurt me, Savin. See! You hurt me!”</p>

<p>But the gamekeeper, swayed by his anger, did not
listen to her complaint.</p>

<p>“A blow!” cried he. “You wished to strike me—<i>you</i>!
Before all these people!”</p>

<p>Catherine reiterated her complaint.</p>

<p>“Be quiet,” said her husband, in tones of thunder.
“Do not forget that I am Savin Barrau. You will have
cause to remember this twentieth of July. Ask my pardon!”</p>

<p>At these words Catherine made another effort to
release herself from his grasp, but Savin held her all
the more firmly.</p>

<p>“Apologize, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“I will not!”</p>

<p>Pride overcame her pain. Her arm was aching terribly,
but—she would never yield. Drops of perspiration
stood on her forehead. Her heart within her
seemed to stop beating. Though ready to faint, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Page 13]</span>
still would have resisted, but her suffering was too
great.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” she cried, at length, in a grieved voice.</p>

<p>“You will not do so again?” demanded Savin,
severely.</p>

<p>“No, no. Release me!”</p>

<p>“You will never again do so rude a thing?”</p>

<p>“No. Oh, how you hurt me!”</p>

<p>Savin dropped her arm and pushed her toward the
pathway.</p>

<p>“Come, let us go,” said he.</p>

<p>Catherine, humiliated and angry, did not resist.
Without once turning her head, Madame Barrau walked
away, bewildered and wretched.</p>

<p>No one had thought of interfering between the man
and wife. Country people, as a rule, have great respect
for strength and authority. Savin’s behavior seemed to
them quite the natural sequence of Catherine’s.</p>

<p>A profound silence reigned for several minutes. By
tacit consent all waited until the gamekeeper and his
wife were beyond hearing, and then soon enough each
tongue began to wag. Catherine was very pretty, and
therefore could not escape calumny. More than one
venomous smile was to be seen on the lips of her enemies.</p>

<p>“Did you see what a look she gave him when they
started?”</p>

<p>“And how vexed she was because he came?”</p>

<p>“She could have strangled him,” said Andoche, wickedly.</p>

<p>“Poor Barrau! how sad!”</p>

<p>Bruno alone was silent. Now and then he opened
his mouth as though he had something to say, but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Page 14]</span>
closed it again without speaking. Amid the babble
Firmin ventured a word. He had been a valet in Paris,
and more than one pretty chambermaid had smiled
upon him: so he felt himself to be quite a squire of
dames.</p>

<p>“Madame Barrau is such a fine-looking woman that
her husband ought to be satisfied if—if—don’t you
know?”</p>

<p>Every one save Bruno burst into laughter. He turned
pale, clinched his fists, and muttered something to himself.
Finally he said with vehemence, as he planted
himself before Firmin: “You are a scoundrel. You,
at least, have no right to say anything. I repeat, you
are a scoundrel!”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear fellow, how excited you are!”</p>

<p>“You know very well that Madame Catherine is an
honest woman. I will answer for it, and I forbid you to
say a word to the contrary.”</p>

<p>“You forbid me! You forbid me!” retorted Firmin,
pale and exasperated. “And what if I laugh in your
face?”</p>

<p>“I will break your head as I would a cat’s,” cried
Bruno, more and more enraged.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha!” said Andoche, in his maddening way: “<i>you</i>
are then in love with Madame Catherine?”</p>

<p>“I also forbid you to speak like that, Andoche. Indeed,
one ought never to allow drunkards in company.”</p>

<p>He must be a hot-brained fellow to speak like that—this
young Bruno.</p>

<p>Fair-skinned, slight, graceful, and blond, the son of
Mother Mathurine would have been taken anywhere for
a gentleman. But he could not boast that strength of
limb and muscle which distinguished the young fellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Page 15]</span>
with whom he had often come in contact, and who were
always ready for a quarrel.</p>

<p>Firmin was as strong as an ox, and Andoche, the old
blacksmith, had sinews of steel. Young Bruno could
hardly expect to enter the lists with either, and he was
rather foolhardy to challenge a dispute. Firmin and
Andoche Grignon were both well enough settled in life,
in a pecuniary way; while young Bruno was but the
son of a poor mother, who passed as a good woman,
though his father had insisted upon remaining away
from home for over twenty years.</p>

<p>Bruno’s last remark lent a sharp piquancy to the situation.
The women were quite elated at the prospect of
a dispute; while the men crowded around, fearing lest
they should lose a word. Andoche frowned and his
face assumed an ugly expression. He never hesitated
to give a blow, and his two short arms had a terrible
reputation at Quarré, Rouvray, and Trinquelin.</p>

<p>“Who ever saw such an insolent cur?” said he, livid
with rage.</p>

<p>For an answer Bruno struck his fist full upon the fat,
red face of the stupefied Andoche. The blacksmith,
for such he was, in his ill-fitting clothes, stood gaping,
with his mouth and eyes wide open—struck dumb for a
moment by the young man’s temerity. Had he been
inebriated, as was often the case, he would not have
hesitated. But now he seemed half afraid, until Firmin’s
jeering voice goaded him to violence.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” roared Andoche, desperately, “take
that!” And he planted a cruel blow upon Bruno’s chest.
Poor Bruno! he fell in a heap upon the grass. Andoche,
making the most of his advantage, then leaped upon his
adversary. The unfortunate fellow, brave to the last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Page 16]</span>
rose to his knees only to receive another stinging blow.
Firmin, meanwhile, showed himself the coward by urging
the blacksmith to greater violence. Andoche again
furiously seized the young man by the throat and would
have strangled him, but for a new-comer, a man brawny
and wiry, who stepped forward, suddenly took the
blacksmith himself by the throat and pressed him so
hard that, muttering a cry of pain, he relaxed his hold
upon Bruno and tried to get away.</p>

<p>“The Bear!” he cried, in a stifled voice. He scarcely
found himself released, when in a spasm of rage Bruno’s
adversary started to punish the man who had interfered.
But the tables were turned. With no great effort “the
Bear” took Andoche between his iron hands, raised
and hurled him to the ground. A stronger man than
Andoche was master of the field.</p>

<p>“It is cowardly,” said he, “to beat a fellow like that.
Andoche, let Firmin and Bruno settle the dispute.
Bruno is courageous, and Firmin is cowardly. That
statement is but just. But you! I should have thought
you more honorable!”</p>

<p>“What a shock you gave me!” pitifully cried
Andoche, who had no desire to prolong the fight.</p>

<p>“What caused the row? Bruno is not the lad to be
incensed for nothing.”</p>

<p>“They were doubting the purity of Madame Catherine,”
said Bruno.</p>

<p>“The gamekeeper’s wife?” queried “the Bear,” with
some agitation.</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame Barrau, if you please.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said “the Bear,” with an assumed nonchalance.
Then after a slight pause he added: “It is
none of my affair. But if again I catch you attacking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Page 17]</span>
a man like little Bruno, Andoche, I will dash you to
pieces.”</p>

<p>The blacksmith, remembering his last lesson, hung
his head and said nothing.</p>

<p>“Bruno, my lad, come with me,” said “the Bear,” as
he turned to go. But Bruno did not wish to retreat
under another’s protection like a coward.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” he said: “I will remain.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” returned “the Bear.” “Man is a free
agent.”</p>

<p>And the shaggy-haired, strongly built man shambled
away without asking if Andoche intended to renew the
fight, which was far from Andoche’s wish. He had
received a lesson. The women, however, continued to
score and revile Catherine. Said one old gossip:
“Well, that fool of a Savin has no more than he deserves.
When a man marries he ought not to choose a
girl who is neither a peasant nor a lady.”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” said Bruno, irritably.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! you are sensitive on the subject, eh?”</p>

<p>But the interest in the discussion soon flagged, and
presently they began to pick berries.</p>

		CHAPTER III.<br>
		<small>THE CORNER OF THE WOOD.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Under arches of foliage made beautiful by an occasional
stray gleam of sunshine, Savin and Catherine
walked homeward in silence.</p>

<p>With tears trickling down her cheeks and suffusing
her long eyelashes, the young woman put one foot
before the other like an automaton, and saw nothing
but the black earth under her feet. She took no notice
of the trees and blossoming flowers, of the delicate blue
gentians that fringed the path, of the soothing peace of
nature.</p>

<p>At any other time Catherine would have gloried in
the picture. The sylvan verdure, the fragrant air, the
exquisite landscape had always appealed to her sense of
the beautiful. But now, with downcast eyes, she cared
not for the charming spectacle.</p>

<p>Savin, too, was an ardent admirer of nature, and he
passionately loved the grand old forest. But now, jealous
and discontented, he walked moodily along, while
Patachaud, leaping by his side, in vain pleaded for
attention.</p>

<p>For a long time Barrau and his wife proceeded without
speaking, each keeping to his or her own path and
brooding over the sorrowful situation. And yet how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Page 19]</span>
charming they were—she with her raven hair and lustrous
dark eyes, straight aquiline nose, and perfect
mouth; and he, a man of thirty-two, with the carriage
of a soldier, and a strong intellectual face, a rich deep
voice, and skin bronzed by the summer sun. A blond
mustache gave to his face a look which the French are
accustomed to trace back to their ancestors the Gauls.
Certainly there could not have been found in all the
countryside two handsomer persons than Savin and
Catherine. Faithfully and fondly, too, had they loved
each other, and until now had been happy. But a little
coquetry and ardent love for pleasure on the one hand,
and jealousy on the other, had spoiled it all, and—who
could tell?—might lead to the direst misery.</p>

<p>Barrau did not know how imprudent it is for a man
to take the conceit out of a pretty woman, and Catherine
did not realize how hard it is to attempt to dissuade a
strong man from what he considers right.</p>

<p>And so they, at length, reached the border of the
wood—she ruminating upon vengeance, and he almost
tragically annoyed by the thought that they had given
cause for scandal to the gossips they had left behind.</p>

<p>Finally, the path became more devious, and as they
advanced the magnificent beauty of the scene burst upon
them. Through an opening in the trees the sun burned
like a ball of fire. From every hand were wafted strains
of rapturous melody. Thousands of feathered songsters
were joining in one grand chorus of praise to God.</p>

<p>Affected in spite of himself, Savin’s face became more
gentle, while Catherine’s softened almost to tenderness.
But the moment of possible reconciliation passed, and
home was reached.</p>

<p>Upon a small bluff, half hidden by trees, stood a cosy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Page 20]</span>
little cottage, built of wood and brick. As if conscious
of its modest architectural pretensions, the <i>chalet</i> was
quite enveloped in a network of clematis and woodbine,
and a rustic veranda afforded a picturesque effect to
the tiny villa. Behind it the forest plunged into a vast
ravine, at the bottom of which brawled a little brook
among the rocks. The mid-day sunlight beat upon the
<i>façade</i> of the cottage and radiantly glinted the leaves of
the surrounding trees, among which a dozen or more
poplars extended a grateful shade over the little garden.</p>

<p>Catherine and Savin did not linger without, but entered
the house together. The former, throwing upon
the table the fichu she had worn, seated herself by the
open window and began nervously tapping the floor
with her foot.</p>

<p>A quarrel seemed imminent. Once more in their own
home Catherine knew her husband would cease to be
vehement. Barrau seated himself on one side of the
table and watched Patachaud as he eagerly drank a cup
of water which was always ready for him. Two strangers
passed by, remarking on the flowers which covered
the cottage roof.</p>

<p>At length, Barrau rose from his chair and broke the
silence by saying: “We must have dinner now, Catherine.”</p>

<p>“You are hungry, then,” said she, with reproach.
“Well, then, go and eat. I do not prevent you. Surely
in order to keep so <i>strong</i> as you are, you must eat
heartily.”</p>

<p>Her words cut him to his soul’s quick.</p>

<p>“Do not be rebellious, Catherine. Come, now.”</p>

<p>She bounded to her feet and bent upon him her flashing
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Page 21]</span></p>

<p>“It is I who am wrong, then. I am the culprit, eh?
You strike me, and then call me rebellious. Indeed, I
ought to rebel, and for good, too.”</p>

<p>“Catherine,” said Savin severely.</p>

<p>“Ah, why did I marry a common brutal soldier?”</p>

<p>Barrau blushed. The thrust struck home.</p>

<p>“Enough! Enough!” said he, rudely; “I am the
master here, at least. And any honest woman should
not make such a remark.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I am a worthless jade, am I? A coquette?
A good-for-nothing?”</p>

<p>Savin made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>“Say it,” she went on; “do not hesitate.”</p>

<p>As though to prevent further disagreement, Savin
started to go, but his anger forced him to stop and say:
“Ah, well, yes. Yes, then! A woman who compromises
herself in the presence of evil tongues has no self-respect.”</p>

<p>“Take care!” cried Catherine, advancing toward him
in anger.</p>

<p>“Take care yourself, my child. Do your duty and
be circumspect is all I ask. But no more coquetry, you
understand, or——”</p>

<p>“Or—you will kill me, perhaps. Well, then, do it.
Kill me, if you will.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” said he, solemnly, “I do not come from
a family of assassins.”</p>

<p>Catherine’s face turned livid. She fell heavily to the
floor, and Savin could have bitten his tongue out for
his cruel words.</p>

		CHAPTER IV.<br>
		<small>THE STAMPEDE.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Three weeks later. The annual cattle show at St.
Benoit is about to open. St. Benoit is the great region
for fine cattle in France. From miles around the farmers
and peasants assemble to exhibit the beasts they
have fattened to sell in Paris at a reasonable profit.</p>

<p>Every road is crowded. Oxen, cows, and sheep fill
the thoroughfares and byways, and the quaint rural habitations
are gayly decorated with flags and streamers.
Not a drop of rain has fallen since the famous day of
the raspberry <i>fête</i>, and each morning the sun has risen
in the east with more scorching radiance.</p>

<p>The large hamlet of St. Benoit, perfectly suited to
such a fair, is crowded in spite of its size. As the sun
climbs above the horizon, the cattle accumulate in greater
numbers. The peasants are in the best of good spirits,
and talk is heard and laughter rings on all sides. Perhaps
the buyers are treated with rather more deference than
the sellers, but those who come neither to buy nor to
sell address themselves to the various schemes of pleasure.
The fair is for everybody, and, at all events, it
offers an admirable opportunity to “eat, drink, and be
merry.”</p>

<p>The two public houses of the place are not without
guests, and the respective landlords are gathering in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Page 23]</span>
goodly supply of the <i>sine qua non</i> of life and not stopping
to count the centimes. More than one young rascal,
with nothing to sell and no money to buy, finds his
way to the village inn and does not leave there thirsty.
Among this class are two men who make more noise
than all the rest, and who await the inevitable fistic
encounter with interest. One of them is Andoche the
blacksmith, an expert in his trade, but still more skilful
in spoiling wine by drinking it.</p>

<p>As he sits just outside the door of the public house, at
one of the tables, he appears ill at ease. In the rural
portions of France people do not like to drink conspicuously,
but in Paris it is different. The peasant, conscious
that he might better spend his money in some
other direction, prefers to take his libations under cover
or behind a screen. To get tipsy is all well enough, he
thinks; but it is not necessary that the whole world
should witness the process from start to finish.</p>

<p>At length, Andoche and his friend proceed to the
fair-grounds, not because they prefer to do so, but for
the very simple reason that Jeanrobert, the landlord,
will not trust either for another centime’s worth. Andoche
cannot hope to find another man so generous as
Fadard, with whom he has taken his last tipple. Fadard
is either an old man who seems to have petrified in his
youth, or a young man who too soon has been claimed
by a precocious old age. Fadard does not belong in
the town, but everybody knows him, for several times in
the course of a year he comes to pay his respects—as
he claims—to one Léocadia Faillot, who passes as his
cousin. Evil tongues, like those of Rosalie and Victoire,
make up all sorts of stories in regard to them;
but they really do Mlle. Faillot an injustice. The fact<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Page 24]</span>
is, this dried-up old young or young old man is actually
a <i>relative</i>, who only comes to see her to borrow money
now and then.</p>

<p>In the centre of the market-place, the Mayor, a large,
solemn old man, stands talking with four or five equally
aged citizens. He is a hardy old man of eighty-five
years, strong as an oak, straight as a classic marble
pillar, but avaricious, penurious, and cunning in the
extreme. He owes his administrative position alone to
his skilful management in once conducting a herd of
cattle through the circuitous pathways of Forêt-au-Duc.
A more truly imposing sight than that of the sturdy old
man driving his oxen, and making them obey with a
simple touch of the lash, could scarcely be found. As
he stands near the cattle, suddenly a refractory bull,
seizing his opportunity, lowers his horns as if to strike.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Father Jerome,” speaks a voice behind
him at this moment, “but, at your age, a blow
from a bull would be an ugly present.”</p>

<p>“It is you, then, Savin, my boy. Thanks for your
caution. And how is Madame Catherine to-day?”</p>

<p>Savin’s face takes on a glowering look.</p>

<p>“For good health, my wife has no equal,” he replies,
evasively.</p>

<p>“Well, well, that is certainly a blessing. But does
she remain as indifferent?”</p>

<p>“There is no change, good father,” answered Savin,
sadly.</p>

<p>Madame Barrau herself now joins the group, and so
the subject is dropped. While they greet Catherine
with due courtesy, it is plain to see that a barrier divides
the husband and wife. Catherine remains but a moment,
and then excuses herself to speak with an acquaintance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Page 25]</span>
As for Savin, he waits an instant after her
departure, and then turning upon his heel walks away
in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Noble fellow,” observes the Mayor, as Savin disappears
from view. “I fear he has made a bitter mistake.”</p>

<p>“What! In marrying D’Angerolles’s daughter?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Opinions differ as to that. Some say he loved her
in secret for many months, while that sot of an Andoche
declares that he was caught in a trap.”</p>

<p>“She is not the wife for him, that is certain.”</p>

<p>“Be that as it may, he has been captured by the fair
Catherine. How—nobody knows.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but somebody knows,” insists Parjeau, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Why, Andoche, to be sure. He is coming this way.
Shall I call him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, on condition that he is sober. When in his cups
he respects neither man nor beast.”</p>

<p>Celestin Parjeau beckons to the blacksmith, but the
latter, fearing lest he lose a chance to gain another
“smile,” pretends not to see the signal. One of the
little urchins playing near by is sent to bring him, and
so Andoche is obliged to join them.</p>

<p>“The gamekeeper,” he begins, “you want to know
about him? A very delicate subject to discuss, because
one cannot speak openly. The army teaches us two
great duties. One is never to imbibe spirituous liquors
to excess, and the other is to be generous in dealing
with all questions of sentiment, especially where a
woman is concerned, and practically to say nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Page 26]</span>
I am a soldier and have had experience in those
things.”</p>

<p>“You are drunk again,” remarks the Mayor, candidly.</p>

<p>“I? Indeed, no! You may place Parjeau there in
my arms, and I will carry him straight as a die to the
post road.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are not intoxicated, you at least are
talking nonsense—cheap nonsense.”</p>

<p>“But I have more to say.”</p>

<p>“Well, proceed, but be quick about it.”</p>

<p>“You were speaking of Savin, eh? A man who is
the soul of honor, and generous, too, by the saints.
Being a sergeant-major he knows the world as it stands.
He has seen service, too, and——”</p>

<p>“To the point,” cry his hearers, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, why pursue the subject? You all know
D’Angerolles’s story.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He was suspected of shooting——”</p>

<p>“Suspected?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Andoche. It was but a mere suspicion.”</p>

<p>“They found old Martin dead on his doorstep. D’Angerolles
had passed by only twenty-five minutes before,
with his gun on his shoulder, and as a report was heard
but a moment previous to his quitting the mill, you understand,
it looked more than suspicious.”</p>

<p>“But, Andoche, D’Angerolles had no motive or object
in killing Martin.”</p>

<p>“Vengeance is strong.”</p>

<p>“But he never said a word against the old man.”</p>

<p>“That counts for nothing.”</p>

<p>“But how is Savin concerned?”</p>

<p>“True—I had forgotten. Savin, full of sympathy
and kind-heartedness, took D’Angerolles’s part in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Page 27]</span>
affair and bravely upheld him from beginning to end.
Nobody could speak aught against Catherine’s father
before him.”</p>

<p>“Did he love her at that time?”</p>

<p>“It appears not. But her youth, after her father’s
death, appealed to him. She was all alone and unprotected
from the taunts of malevolent persons who
went so far as to call her the daughter of an assassin.
None spoke to her save to insult her, and her life was
wretched. Poor child! She cried day and night. Somebody
advised her to go away—to Paris—where no questions
would be asked. But Savin came to the rescue.
He learned how cruelly people were talking about her
and he was incensed. He picked many a quarrel on her
account. Among others Rosalie did not hesitate to calumniate
Mademoiselle d’Angerolles and to insinuate
that between her and Savin too intimate relations existed.
At this Barrau was furious, of course, and the
upshot of it all was that he protected Catherine by
making her his wife. Nobody now dares to say a word.
But it was a queer thing, after all. Had she been a
peasant, it would have seemed different. But her father
was a gentleman, and it appears she has no common
talent for learning.”</p>

<p>“That is nothing derogatory to her character, my
friend.”</p>

<p>“No, but we do not live like Parisians here. A different
<i>ménage</i> might better please the haughty Catherine.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Her lot should be a happy one.”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” breaks out Andoche, “let us drink to
our Mayor’s health.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, thanks, Andoche; but none for me, if you
please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Page 28]</span></p>

<p>“Upon my invitation? I beg you will not refuse,”
returns Andoche, with mock politeness. “As a soldier
and gentleman, however, I will have the grace to excuse
you should you insist.”</p>

<p>The Mayor, Parjeau, and others refuse, and the blacksmith
turns to join his companion, Fadard. The fair
progresses, the business transactions being concluded
with more celerity as the heat becomes more intense.
The sun tortures the animals like the close heat of a
furnace fire. Those that by fortunate chance are near
wells or ponds can leap in and cool themselves in the
water, but the rest—that is to say, ninety per cent. of
them—raise their parched heads toward heaven as if
seeking some rain-cloud to refresh themselves. Besides,
the flies, the mosquitoes, and especially the gnats exasperate
them to desperation.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no person on the face of the earth
more invulnerable to the sun’s rays than the French
peasant. To-day, however, there is a general admission
that it is intolerably hot. Some, fearing that even their
cattle may die of sunstroke, place them under shelter
without reference to whether they can be sold. But
many poor beasts are left to suffer, and their piteous
lowing is distinctly heard above the hum and din of the
fair.</p>

<p>The Mayor, with his experienced eye, surveys the
scene on all sides. Like a mariner who feels a coming
storm before any sign is evident to his eyes, Father
Jerome has the air of a man who foresees danger.
Walking in the shade of the great trees, he touches his
neighbor’s elbow and says: “My friend, this heat is
going to play bad pranks on us.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” demands Parjeau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Page 29]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> It is not well to predict evil, but do
you see those eight or ten yoke of oxen down there by
Simmonet’s mill? Well, there it will begin—the stampede,
I mean. Do you see that great ox rearing in the
air and——”</p>

<p>The sense of danger makes him silent, and rushing
to the nearest house he shouts at the top of his voice:
“A stampede! A stampede! Call the women and
children in quickly!”</p>

<p>“What! Is old Father Jerome crazy?” cries Andoche,
who remains seated at a table, half overcome by his
potations. Others at once realize the danger, and shouts
of “A stampede!” resound in the ears of the peasants
like the peals of a tocsin.</p>

<p>Among marching armies as well as sleeping camps
sometimes a terrible fright takes possession of soldiers.
The horror-stricken men, without a moment’s pause,
throw down their arms and run here and there in mad
confusion. How many times has a general, sure of his
campaign, seen victory vanish because of a sudden panic
without reason and for which nobody (?) is responsible.</p>

<p>So with these cattle that a moment since were quiet
and under control. Some nameless terror, like an insidious
simoom, has seized the herd. The fury spreads
like magic, and they madly plunge and rear, and turn
the market-place into a scene of wild and noisy chaos.
The danger is supreme. “A stampede!” The appalling
announcement echoes like a peal of thunder throughout
the startled fair.</p>

<p>Then suddenly an ominous stillness prevails, and for
half a minute not a movement is made among the frightened
people who are watching the spectacle from a
neighboring cottage. But an unearthly bellowing breaks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Page 30]</span>
the brief silence, and with heads erect and glittering
eyes the cattle madly paw the ground, upturning stones
and tearing up the earth until thick, blinding clouds of
dust obscure the landscape. Who now can doubt the
danger? The merciless sun goads the herd to frenzy.</p>

<p>Fadard, intoxicated but still prudent, followed by
Andoche, approaches the door of the <i>cabaret</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> where
they have been dawdling. A cloud of hot dust fills
their eyes and nostrils, and they gladly seek refuge
within.</p>

<p>At the same moment the distracted beasts make another
dash. Like demons they career about the market-place,
trampling upon and killing each other in their
desperate struggle to reach the exit gates. Through
these they plunge and go tearing along the highway,
the earth seeming to tremble beneath their feet. The
little booths by the wayside are far from safe. A part
of Andoche’s jacket is carried away impaled upon the
horn of a bull which has dashed against the wall of the
<i>cabaret</i>. Consternation fills the hearts of the villagers.
All who have dear ones abroad on the road or in the
fields are pale with anguish. Children, too, are missing,
and the suspense is heart-breaking. What will be the
sequel? They hardly dare look out to see if the storm
and fury have at all abated.</p>

<p>Under a cart-shed at the end of the market-place
stands a huddled group of men. They await the end.
Suddenly a little child, about two years old, runs out of
a wood-chopper’s house and starts across the road along
which a part of the herd is still rushing like a whirlwind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Page 31]</span></p>

<p>“He will be killed!” yelled some one, as a young
heifer racing forward just overleaps the boy.</p>

<p>But a special providence seems to protect children,
and for the nonce the little fellow escapes. He miraculously
reaches the shed unharmed. There is not a man
in the cart-shed who is not thrilled with the desire to go
and save other little ones from certain death. To be
sure, many sit rooted to the spot, lacking the courage
to move; but not all of them are cowards.</p>

<p>Just as a young girl ventures to cross the road, an
enormous bull comes thundering along. She is in imminent
peril. Who will attempt an heroic act of rescue?
A sickening fear seizes the spectators. Onward course
the foaming animals, following in the dusty wake of
their formidable leader.</p>

<p>Not an instant too soon some one rushes out of a
neighboring cottage and, clasping the young girl in his
arms, prepares to shield her from the oncoming cattle.
His presence of mind is remarkable; but no time is left
for escape, for the herd is upon him. He makes one
more effective move—he hurls the little maid into a
clump of rushes, where she falls heavily, but beyond the
pale of danger. He rolls under the trampling hoofs,
and the whole battalion of beasts passes over the body
of one who has attempted the impossible. What a terrible
sight! He is crushed and bruised, but they expect
to find him a shapeless mass.</p>

<p>“Who is he?” shout a hundred or more people
nearly in unison.</p>

<p>“I believe he is Bruno Volane,” answers a peasant of
Trinquelin.</p>

<p>“It’s just like him,” observes an old woman, “to rush
to certain death. Ah! but he is brave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Page 32]</span></p>

<p>By this time the people, too, are in a panic. Husbands
and wives and parents and children have become
separated, and terrible havoc has been made by the cattle
along the roads, and valuable beasts are lost or killed.
The adjacent country looks not unlike a battle-field.
Here and there the wounded beasts lie bleeding upon
the ground. The market-place shows traces of an unusual
struggle and of hard usage; the cottages are battered,
windows knocked out and doors unhinged.</p>

<p>This stampede surpasses anything in the way of a
calamity ever known in the annals of St. Benoit.</p>

<p>At length, a man armed with a cudgel strides forth as
if to encounter the foe. Each advancing bull is driven
into the ring by the man Andoche calls “the Bear.” He
is a singular-looking figure as he stands there, with his
unkempt beard and hair fluttering in the breeze.</p>

<p>Rushing to the spot where Bruno has fallen, L’Ours
(“the Bear”) takes a guarded attitude and then strikes
out in every direction, beating down the cattle right
and left.</p>

<p>“He will be killed!” cries some one. “Why should
he go to Bruno’s aid now? The fellow must certainly
be dead.”</p>

<p>“Have you not noticed that L’Ours always happens
around when Mother Mathurine’s son is in danger?”</p>

<p>“Yes—how strange it is!”</p>

<p>“And why is it?” asks Rosalie, who is always prying
into others’ affairs, being the most inquisitive of women.</p>

<p>“Why? Why? Go and ask <i>him</i>. Perhaps he will
tell you.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile L’Ours is beating off the infuriated animals,
and the panic gradually subsides. Seizing Bruno
with one hand and protecting himself with the other, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Page 33]</span>
speeds to a neighboring cottage, regardless of the disorder
and confusion that prevail.</p>

<p>The house in question belongs to an eccentric personage,
well known throughout the country for his benevolence.
Assistance is never withheld from the worthy
seeker by Monsieur Eugène. Day and night he is always
ready to give advice or succor to the unfortunate,
and one can enter his house without going through the
form of knocking. A welcome is always certain and
the latch-string is never within.</p>

<p>Without ceremony, therefore, L’Ours enters the cottage,
and advancing to a couch gently places his burden
on the counterpane. A crowd of curious people has followed
and now enters in procession. Bruno’s eyes and
cheeks are ghastly with blood and his lips are set and
colorless. As he lies motionless upon the bed Jean
Manant (L’Ours) begins to feel his hands and limbs
with anxious haste.</p>

<p>“Nothing broken here,” he remarks, stroking the unfortunate’s
left leg. “Nor there, nor there,” he continues,
probing Bruno’s arms and chest. Large beads of
perspiration stand on his forehead and tears fall from
his eyes like rain.</p>

<p>Monsieur Eugène arrives at this moment.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” he inquires solicitously.</p>

<p>Jean makes no reply, and Brigitte Martinet and Félicité
Mafflu proceed in discordant concert to relate the
adventure. As both speak at once and each has a different
version to tell, Eugène is unable to understand a
word. So calling Catherine, who is lingering near the
door, he says: “Madame Barrau, will you have the
kindness to explain the situation? Come, Brigitte, let
Madame speak.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Page 34]</span></p>

<p>Catherine comes forward. All are surprised at her
lack of emotion. In a few words she tells Monsieur
Eugène all the circumstances: how Bruno rushed to the
child’s rescue, and how Jean bravely fought his way to
Bruno’s prostrate body and carried him here.</p>

<p>“Remarkable!” exclaims Monsieur in cheerful tones.
“And now, good people, do me the favor to wait outside
in the yard until we see what can be done. Too many
here will be an inconvenience, but one or two of you
may stay to assist.”</p>

<p>Catherine and Sidonie, the little cripple, remain, but
the others file slowly out into the yard. As she is leaving
an old peasant woman is motioned to remain. She
is a nonentity, but a woman who will follow Monsieur
Eugène’s directions to the letter without a quiver of the
eyelids or the lips. Nothing astonishes her, for she is
like an iceberg—immovable and unfathomable. In the
village there are people who declare she never speaks.
Jeannille Marselon is a curiosity to the villagers, who
years since have ceased trying to thaw out this living
icicle.</p>

		CHAPTER V.<br>
		<small>SIDONIE.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Scarcely had the door closed upon the crowd when
Monsieur Eugène threw off his coat, and bending over
Bruno’s prostrate form said:</p>

<p>“First let us see if there is life.”</p>

<p>With these words he rested his head on Bruno’s
chest. Jean Manant could hardly breathe, so deep was
his dread of the possible truth; while poor little Sidonie
was choked with anguish. After a moment of cruel
suspense Eugène raised his head sadly, as if to regain
his breath, and then once more inclined his ear.</p>

<p>Jean Manant and Sidonie were in despair. Catherine
alone remained calm and collected. A few more moments
of suspense passed, and then with a little cry
Monsieur Eugène sprang up.</p>

<p>“He is living. His heart is beating, though faintly,”
said he. “Wait!”</p>

<p>He immediately selected a lance from an unpretentious
little surgeon’s case near by and summoned the
three women to help him.</p>

<p>“Here, Jeannille,” he quickly called, “support Bruno’s
head and shoulders—like that. And you, Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Page 36]</span>
Barrau, will you kindly hold his wrist firmly? You are
not easily frightened, are you? I am going to bleed
him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Catherine, without a sign of
flinching, as she seized his wrist, but poor Sidonie was
trembling like an aspen-leaf.</p>

<p>Under the lance the vein was opened and there
spurted out a stream of blood, the sight of which nearly
distracted the little lame girl.</p>

<p>“Good! good!” said Monsieur Eugène, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Is he saved?” asked Jean in a trembling whisper.</p>

<p>“At all events, the chances are in his favor.”</p>

<p>“But those cattle must have crushed his bones,” insisted
Manant, who was still possessed by a horrible
doubt.</p>

<p>“Jean, my boy, it is a miracle; but, barring more or
less severe contusions, Bruno has escaped.”</p>

<p>Still incredulous, Jean regarded Monsieur Eugène
steadily for half a minute as if to read the truth in the
latter’s face. Calmly Eugène returned his gaze and
soon Jean’s doubts vanished, for a sigh fell from Bruno’s
lips.</p>

<p>A great joy illumined Manant’s face and Sidonie
lifted her eyes in prayer. Old Jeannille sat unmoved
and impenetrable. Catherine looked at the young man
a little curiously. He seemed too slender and delicate
a fellow to be so daring. His white arm was like a
woman’s. Indeed, what woman in St. Benoit could not
boast of more muscle than he? And his slender wrist
inspired a sort of pity in her breast.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” she murmured to herself, as she
reflected how ardently, though respectfully, Bruno loved
her—not daring to confess it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Page 37]</span></p>

<p>Poor fellow, indeed!</p>

<p>Sidonie gazed upon his shapely form in mute admiration.
How perfect he seemed to her. How noble and
graceful. Ah! could he but learn to love her!</p>

<p>Bruno moved gently. Another sigh—a deeper one
than before—came from his lips. Monsieur Eugène
was bathing his wounds with arnica and bandaging
them. Bruno’s long-fringed drooping eyelids feebly
opened, and he slowly looked around him.</p>

<p>Catherine affected an air of cool indifference, but
Sidonie wore a look of absolute devotion. Bruno abruptly
changed his gaze from the lame girl’s enraptured
face to Madame Barrau’s, and his own became radiant
for a moment. A bit of color crept into his cheeks.
Catherine continued to hold his wrist while the vein was
bleeding, and the contact of her soft hand sent a delicious
magnetic thrill through his body.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Madame Catherine,” he murmured—hardly
above a whisper—and then, with a smile on his
lips, he again fainted away.</p>

<p>Catherine also smiled, but in a spirit of triumph, and
Jeannille turned upon her a look of such frigidity
that the gamekeeper’s wife, blushing and disconcerted,
asked if the operation was not nearly over.</p>

<p>“A moment more; but if you are tired Jean will
relieve you,” answered Monsieur Eugène. Jean Manant
did not require a second bidding. With a delicacy
that was wonderful in so clumsy a man, he took Bruno’s
arm in his hands. In a few minutes Bruno returned to
consciousness.</p>

<p>“Where do you suffer?” asked Monsieur Eugène.</p>

<p>“I am not in pain,” said Bruno, his eyes riveted on
Catherine’s face. Just then the door slammed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Page 38]</span></p>

<p>“Who’s there?” shouted Eugène, impatiently.</p>

<p>“It is I, Monsieur,” answered the awkward Firmin,
as he entered.</p>

<p>“What do you want? Didn’t they tell you I was engaged
and did not wish to be disturbed?”</p>

<p>“But important business brings me.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, speak quickly.”</p>

<p>“I wish to ask Monsieur my rights.”</p>

<p>“In what respect?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur knows of the stampede. Well, I had just
bought a pair of oxen from Carassol, who lives at Bocasse,
but they had not been surrendered to me when
the stampede commenced.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, they did like all the rest. They ran away.”</p>

<p>“Ah! And Carassol claims that the transaction was
concluded in good faith and that he is not responsible
for the oxen?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Let us see, Finnin. Had you been drinking?”</p>

<p>“To speak honestly, a little, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>“That is right—be honest. Do you know where Carassol’s
oxen were standing?”</p>

<p>“Near the watering-trough.”</p>

<p>“And you wish my opinion in the matter? Listen.
Carassol must assist you to recover the oxen, and you
must make a diligent search for them.”</p>

<p>“But I have paid for the beasts.”</p>

<p>“Then Carassol is in the right.”</p>

<p>“I will go to law about it.”</p>

<p>“You will lose the case, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall see,” returned Firmin, who, seeing
Catherine, immediately approached her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Page 39]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, good-day, Madame Barrau. Are you well? I
perceive that you are charming as ever.”</p>

<p>Blushing a little at this bold overture, Catherine
answered quietly with a word. Firmin assumed such
an offensive manner toward her that, obliged to treat it
as insolence, she prepared to leave. Firmin, too, showed
his intention to depart.</p>

<p>“<i>Au revoir</i>,” said he. “Thanks for your advice,
Monsieur.”</p>

<p>Catherine, with disgust, turning to go, observed near
the door old Jeannille, who was staring at her with cold,
penetrating eyes.</p>

<p>Catherine again changed color. “It seems as though
she were playing the spy on me,” she thought. “Can
it be that my husband has put a watch over me? If I
knew that to be the fact——”</p>

<p>Always impulsive, Catherine now imagined the worst.
She fancied she had discovered a plot in which everybody
was arrayed against her. “This is the third time
I have caught that old hag watching me as if she
would read my thoughts.”</p>

<p>Firmin, meanwhile, was walking by her side.</p>

<p>“Go away,” said Catherine disdainfully. “One would
think you had taken it upon yourself to compromise
me.”</p>

<p>The man certainly was a sot, but he possessed an
enormous amount of vanity. Catherine’s words therefore
flattered his self-conceit.</p>

<p>“Upon my honor, Madame——”</p>

<p>Firmin for several years had served as valet to a Parisian
gentleman, and he once had heard his master speak
thus to a great lady. So thinking to please Catherine
he made use of the high-sounding phrase, adding <i>sotto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Page 40]</span>
voce</i> in her ear: “Meet me to-morrow at three o’clock
at Bemacle’s Cross, <i>chère</i> madame,” and without waiting
for her reply he passed on ahead with rapid step.</p>

<p>Catherine shrugged her shoulders. A feeling of indignation
took possession of her. She redoubled her pace
and proceeded home. Since the day when Savin humiliated
her before the peasants she had been enraged and
miserable. “On my knees,” she would repeat a dozen
times a day, “he compelled me to ask pardon. On my
knees!” And through her brain all sorts of schemes of
vengeance were flitting. With all the force of her darker
nature she had begun to hate the valiant soldier whose
generosity she should have recognized and reciprocated.
Haunted by the idea that ever since that memorable
day people had distrusted her, she felt able less and less
to strive against the evil spirit to which she had fallen a
prey.</p>

<p>On every side as she walked homeward an extraordinary
confusion reigned. Many were engaged in a
search after the missing cattle. The men taunted each
other and quarrelled, and more than one peasant, after
searching in vain for his cow, ox, or bull, took the one
nearest him and declared without hesitation that it belonged
to him. Nobody can be more ferocious than the
peasant who loses his worldly goods, and in the present
instance more than fifty had been dispossessed.</p>

<p>Fadard stood leaning against the wall in the bar-room
of the inn when Andoche entered. His face had
been rendered hideous by a large gash—the result of a
blow from a bottle. Night was approaching. The sun,
in a flood of glowing crimson and amber, was sinking
beyond the world’s west. The leaves of the tall poplars
were gently soughing as the twilight breeze, prodigal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Page 41]</span>
with caresses, wooed them into soothing accents.
Still the wrathy peasants haggled and disputed the
claims of possession as the animals slowly and with
great difficulty were recaptured. No one claimed the
dead cattle. The controversy was alone confined to the
living. The sun in a final burst of glory flashed a brilliant
farewell to this section of the earth as Madame
Barrau, excited to hatred and anger and imagining all
kinds and degrees of troubles to be hers, went on her
way with downcast eyes. Once, however, she glanced
at the parting orb, whose lustrous rays recalled to her
mind Bruno’s look of joy when he beheld her beside the
couch.</p>

<p>If Catherine had allowed herself to remember only
Savin’s generosity instead of harboring wicked thoughts;
if she had studied the situation and reflected a little,
she would have realized what a meagre sacrifice of self-love
would have won her husband over to devotion once
more. But this effort seemed to her out of the question.
She only remembered that if Savin did not love her
two other men did. Had not Firmin and Bruno evinced
how much she was to be desired? Ah! they would
know—either one of them—how to appreciate her beauty
and fine qualities. Thus onward she walked, with vengeance
in her heart.</p>

<p>Beyond the village comparative calm prevailed. Here
no disputes were heard. On the rustic little bridge she
met Mother Mathurine. The poor woman was hurrying
toward St. Benoit.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Bruno, Madame Catherine?” she
asked, with heart-broken sobs.</p>

<p>“Do not take on so, Mother Mathurine. He is safe.
Monsieur Eugène is taking care of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Page 42]</span></p>

<p>“Tell me the worst, Madame,” pleaded the old
woman.</p>

<p>“I have, Madame. It is true—but he owes his life to
Jean Manant.”</p>

<p>“To <i>him</i>? Did <i>he</i> save him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame. From under the trampling herd he
rescued him.”</p>

<p>“<i>Again!</i> Thanks, Madame Catherine. But I must
hasten to Bruno’s side. I may be able to do something
for him.”</p>

<p>And with quickened steps Mother Mathurine proceeded
to Monsieur Eugène’s house, where she arrived
a few moments later, breathless and trembling. Through
the yard all instinctively made way for her to pass.</p>

<p>“Where is my son?” she asked, hoarsely. They
pointed to the front room. Seeing her enter, Monsieur
Eugène came forward to speak to her.</p>

<p>“One moment before you embrace Bruno. He has
just fainted again.”</p>

<p>“You would tell me he is dead!”</p>

<p>“No! no! He is living and doing well. But you
may embrace a brave lad here and thank him for his
courage,” and Monsieur Eugène pointed to Jean
Manant.</p>

<p>Mother Mathurine, turning, seized his hands and
kissed them.</p>

<p>“Mother Mathurine,” cried the brawny Jean, somewhat
embarrassed, “do not thank <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“What! When you have saved his life for the fourth
time! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> What courage!”</p>

<p>“It was nothing,” answered he, astonished that his
action in Bruno’s behalf should be judged so meritorious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Page 43]</span></p>

<p>At this moment Bruno stirred.</p>

<p>“Bruno wants to embrace you,” observed Monsieur
Eugène to Mother Mathurine.</p>

<p>“O Bruno! Naughty, careless boy,” she cried.
“Did you not promise me that you would not again
expose yourself to danger? You will be the death of
me—running so many risks.”</p>

<p>“What could I do, mother? Could I leave a child to
die without raising a finger to save her?”</p>

<p>“O my boy! You know how much I love you. Do
not torment me again. Be more careful in the future.”</p>

<p>“But you forget, mother, that my friend Jean comes
in time to save me always,” and he seized Manant’s
hand, the latter trying to conceal his emotion. Some
one was silently weeping tears of joy in a secluded
corner of the room. Poor little Sidonie! Ordinarily
she would have hastened to embrace Mother Mathurine.
But now a fear possessed her and she could not trust
herself to speak. For worlds she would not expose her
swollen eyes that Bruno might see what she endured.</p>

<p>“Are you suffering now?” asked Mother Mathurine.</p>

<p>“My body seems broken, but I have no actual pain,”
answered Bruno.</p>

<p>“What a miracle that your brain was not crushed.
God be praised!” said the grateful mother. “But can
you not come home?”</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>“No imprudence, if you please,” expostulated Eugène.
“Bruno must remain here for a few days or a
week if necessary.”</p>

<p>“You are too good, Monsieur Eugène,” said the young
man. “Already I have given you so much trouble.
With Jean’s assistance I can easily go home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Page 44]</span></p>

<p>Sidonie was hoping that Bruno would mention her
presence. The poor girl was looking reproachfully at him
when Mother Mathurine noticed her for the first time.</p>

<p>“Why, Sidonie, child! You have been very quiet.
How long have you been here? Come and kiss me.”</p>

<p>“Madame Catherine also assisted Monsieur Eugène
when he bled my arm. <i>She</i> held it for him,” broke out
Bruno, unconsciously wounding the already suffering
Sidonie.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. I met her on the way here. Poor
Catherine! She looked unhappy!”</p>

<p>“But she ought to be the happiest woman in the village,”
said Monsieur Eugène earnestly.</p>

<p>Bruno’s countenance assumed a peculiar expression,
while Madame Mathurine, who understood matters, drew
little Sidonie closer to her side. “Ah, my dear,” she said
in a whisper, “if it ever depends upon me it is you he
shall choose.” Sidonie clasped Mother Mathurine with
gracious joy.</p>

<p>By the side of Monsieur Eugène old Jeannille sat as
though transfixed, with her eyes sharply directed at the
lame girl. One by one the stars began to blossom in
the heavens. Night was come. Nature had fallen
asleep and the beautiful silver lights were keeping guard
on high.</p>

<p>With renewed thanks to his kind benefactor Bruno,
assisted by Mother Mathurine, Jean, and Sidonie, started
for home. Sidonie’s face beamed with pleasure as the
young man leaned his right arm on her shoulder.
Happy Sidonie! How tender were her thoughts for
him! She stepped with great care lest her limp should
bother him.</p>

<p>The moon now hanging high in the heavens lent an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Page 45]</span>
enchantment to the scene, touching with its mellow light
the grand old trees and tender flowers. A silence more
eloquent than words fell upon the little train; but all in
their hearts thanked God for the beautiful night and for
preserving the well-beloved Bruno from a violent death.</p>

		CHAPTER VI.<br>
		<small>DARK DAYS.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>October with its kaleidoscopic dress comes on apace.
Upon seeing the woods made glorious by the regal hues
of gold and scarlet, we are tempted to say that the ending
season is not less beautiful in its way than the beginning
one. Great yellow patches on the foliage gleam
in the wan sunlight. Nature is ablaze with color. The
holly boughs are flaunting their bold red berries in the
face of the wind, and everywhere the leaves in brilliant
confusion flutter through the air.</p>

<p>Now and then in the distance a gun’s report is heard.
The gamekeepers are now on the alert for prowling
poachers. Water stands in the ditches. The fog is dense
at night and in the morning, and the meadows already
are often too cold for the flocks. The old belfry in the
village—its greatest pride—is a mass of vines, now
turned to vivid crimson.</p>

<p>At the door of his little shop stands Andoche the
blacksmith, adorned with his leather apron. His brawny
arms are bare to the elbows. In one uplifted hand he
holds a glass of wine, while with the other he holds
Firmin by the arm.</p>

<p>“My friend,” says he, “your affairs do not concern
me in the least. You are old enough to know how to
conduct yourself. But if you wish to hear a bit of good
advice I will say—<i>beware!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Page 47]</span></p>

<p>“Of what? Of whom?”</p>

<p>“Of everybody in general and in particular of—Madame
Catherine.”</p>

<p>“The gamekeeper’s wife?” said Firmin, with an
egotistical leer.</p>

<p>“To be sure. There are not <i>two</i> Catherines.”</p>

<p>“Why do you say ‘beware’?”</p>

<p>“Why? Are you a fool?”</p>

<p>“I hope not.”</p>

<p>“Well, my friend, you now have the appearance——”</p>

<p>“O Andoche!”</p>

<p>“Well, old comrade. I may be a drunkard, but you
can make up your mind to one thing—my eyes are wide
open just the same.”</p>

<p>“And what do you see <i>in particular</i> just at present?”</p>

<p>“That you are making a fool of yourself, and I am
not the only one who thinks so.”</p>

<p>Firmin makes an indignant gesture, as though in protest
against the assertion or assumption that a man of
his importance should be so regarded by his friends; as
though he could be led about by the nose! He—Firmin!</p>

<p>“Your health, Firmin,” adds Andoche, touching his
visitor’s glass.</p>

<p>“Here’s to you,” returns Firmin, in a preoccupied
manner.</p>

<p>The blacksmith, having drained his glass to the dregs
with one toss of the hand, goes on to say: “My friend,
I have not lived in the city and frequented the haunts
of society like you—though I was once in garrison at
Château Thierry—but I have a grain or two of common
sense, and were I in your place I should not prowl
around the little cottage over there like a dog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Page 48]</span></p>

<p>“And why, pray, should I not visit the gamekeeper’s
house?”</p>

<p>“Because there are more poachers than millionnaires
in the world.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; only Savin Barrau is a man who attends
strictly to his own business.”</p>

<p>“And how does that concern me?”</p>

<p>“Ah, so you do not understand? Well, then, come
into my shop and I will explain. Now then,” he continues
as they seat themselves inside the little shop,
“only four days ago Savin was shot at by some poacher
on his mistress’ preserves.”</p>

<p>“So I heard. Well?”</p>

<p>“The bullet missed that time, but who knows whether
he will escape the next?”</p>

<p>“That does not concern me.”</p>

<p>“But don’t you see, you simpleton, that if Savin is
killed, the world will say you, egged on by Catherine,
committed the deed?”</p>

<p>“What? You mean——”</p>

<p>“If such a thing should occur, there are two of you
to prove an alibi.”</p>

<p>“Two? How so?”</p>

<p>“Bruno also might be suspected.”</p>

<p>“That young scamp? But she cares nothing for him.”</p>

<p>“Has she said so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a dozen times.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so she converses with you frequently, eh? But,
my friend, that is not the only danger you encounter.
You, too, are sometimes given to poaching.”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I know a thing or two about dogs myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Page 49]</span>
and the young hound crouching there by the forge
with such a harmless air is the finest hunter in St. Benoit,
and we all know the country is not wanting in
good dogs.”</p>

<p>“And what of that, if you please?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, my friend, only should Catherine’s
husband catch you at it a shot from his gun would soon
put an end to you, and the law would exonerate him.
Poachers always get the worst of it in those cases.”</p>

<p>Firmin turns visibly pale. True valor is quite an
unknown quantity in his composition.</p>

<p>“Your health, my boy,” repeats Andoche, “and take
my advice: Be careful what you do. Everybody knows
Madame Catherine’s love of coquetry. It is not that
she cares for you—oh, no! but she hates her husband.
If Barrau at any time since the raspberry <i>fête</i> had but
asked forgiveness, she would have turned her back on
you fast enough, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>In spite of Firmin’s rising indignation, Andoche continues:
“And if she were not so often twitted by the
village girls of being at odds with Savin, she might now,
even, overlook the humiliation she endured that day.
But Rosalie and Félicité are always mocking her on the
subject, and it only adds fuel to the flame. There will
be trouble one of these days, mark my words, and as
you are my friend, I advise you to keep out of it.”</p>

<p>A man of Firmin’s character and disposition, however,
never accepts good advice. His egotism is too great,
his mind too stupid for that. So now, with a supercilious
smile, Firmin listens to Andoche’s not wholly
unreasonable or irrelevant harangue.</p>

<p>“You can accept my advice or not, as you choose,
my friend. But were I in your place, I should much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Page 50]</span>
prefer to pass my time with old Andoche, tinkling the
merry glass of wine, than to throw myself away on a
designing woman.”</p>

<p>Firmin indulges in a burst of laughter.</p>

<p>“So that is your opinion, is it? Well, well—let us
drink a bumper and change the subject, for I am not a
little weary of it, old fellow. Here’s to you and to all
good counselors.”</p>

<p>And so for the time the subject is dropped. Andoche,
however, poor sot that he is, has expressed
opinions that are not altogether wrong.</p>

<p>For over two months Catherine has daily become
more sullen and capricious. At times her face wears a
terrible expression, and though she has lost none of her
beauty, still, under the influence of the fixed idea that
haunts her, she appears less gracious and agreeable. In
her face lurks a defiant, scornful expression, which does
not become her, and her smile is constrained and bitter.
To those who know her well but one solution is evident.</p>

<p>Her thirst for revenge is inordinate. She evinces it
in her actions. And Savin lacks that suppleness of discernment
to characterize it as a craving for revenge, and
thus obtusely fails to endeavor to turn her mind into
other channels. He simply accepts his wife’s silence,
and, to him, only odd conduct as a sudden caprice.</p>

<p>“When she is ready to do so she will return to my
heart’s shelter,” he thinks, little imagining the true state
of the case.</p>

<p>The love and magnanimity he displayed by rescuing
her from the wretched thraldom of her position after the
D’Angerolles <i>esclandre</i>, he assumes, have rendered Catherine
ever grateful to him, and have precluded all chance
of prolonged anger on her part toward him who has so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Page 51]</span>
definitely proven his passion for her. And thus reflecting
and thus reasoning, he waits for her to manifest some
sign of her desire for a reconciliation. But as time goes
on and Madame Barrau reveals more quixotic tendencies,
he becomes impatient. There is naught more
fatiguing than the existence of two people who, forced
to dwell under the same roof, are at war with each
other. Then each word has a special meaning. Every
step, gesture, and movement may be misinterpreted by
the injured one. The torture of mind endured nearly
amounts to frenzy. For a day it is a terrible ordeal; for
months it is a cruel nightmare. Barrau has a magnanimous
nature, and if Catherine should come to him with
one expression of regret he would take her in his arms
eagerly and lovingly. But no. Catherine remains
frigid in feeling and manner. Accordingly Savin,
showing an equal disposition to maintain an obstinate
silence, allows his animosity to ripen. He is exasperated
and unhappy over their relations. To go on living
in this way will soon be unbearable. But he constantly
asks himself what is to be done.</p>

<p>Catherine is quite as miserable. “What! I am not
yet twenty, and must I live all my life under this horrible
yoke? Surely death will be preferable. Ah, if
he but loved me. But he despises me.”</p>

<p>And thus she rebels—racking her brains for some
means of escape. Unfortunately, she has not the nature
which can forgive and forget. To punish the man who
has treated her like a slave—yes, like a <i>slave</i>—that is
her one idea. But how? That is not yet clear to her.</p>

<p>“Only to be free! only to be free!” she repeats. But
how? No solution occurs to her mind until one day
she finds herself saying: “What if Savin should die?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Page 52]</span>
In justice, however, be it said, she rejects that thought
as too horrible. “Wretched creature that I am to think
of it!” she cries.</p>

<p>Alas! how bitter are her reflections. And as she
looks out upon the late autumn landscape and watches
the scattering leaves of red and gold, again she thinks:
“After all, he may not live long. Stronger men than he
have been vanquished by a bad cold—a sudden fever.”</p>

<p>And in imagination she sees him, pale and emaciated,
reduced by sickness to a shadow—in a proper condition
to be humiliated. At this very moment Barrau appears
at the gate, and his powerful step resounds on the gravel.
Patachaud dances about him with canine glee. Graceful,
young, and vigorous, with broad shoulders and
magnificent physique, the gamekeeper advances, opens
the door, and enters.</p>

<p>His presence arouses Catherine from her sullen
revery.</p>

<p>“Fool! that I should dream of his becoming ill.
Why, he is made of iron.”</p>

<p>And brooding over her wretched existence, the idea
of her husband’s death seems less revolting to her.</p>

<p>“It would be still better if he killed me himself,” she
inwardly declares; “I deserve it.”</p>

<p>But a contemptuous smile (or is it a commiserating
look?) from Savin serves to dispel all thoughts save
those of hatred from her breast.</p>

		CHAPTER VII.<br>
		<small>THE INVITATION.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>A merry little troop lined the way leading into the
forest. Song and mirth echoed through the trees as the
happy band tripped along the road, their object being to
invite the Barraus to a wedding. In certain rural parts
of France it is the custom for the engaged couple, their
relatives and best friends to visit in a body those they
desire to invite to the wedding, and the future bridegroom,
if it be a woman addressed, or the future bride,
if it be a man, offers sugar-plums, which if accepted
signifies that the implied invitation to the wedding is
likewise accepted. In refusing, one also refuses to be
present at the wedding. Moreover, a solemn obligation
is involved in the acceptance. Those who partake of
the sweet almonds are expected not only to join in the
festivities, but to furnish a wedding-gift. Eggs, game,
fruit, vegetables, and articles of food are usually the
principal presents received by the happy couple.</p>

<p>The marriage of pretty little Suzanne Perrogon with
Jacques Percier was about to be celebrated. Suzanne
was the niece of Jeannille Marselon, whose strange
character was referred to in the preceding chapter.
Jacques owned a pretty little house and lot—an inheritance
from his mother. In the contract he exacted the
promise that his wife should engage herself formally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Page 54]</span>
after the birth of her first child, as a wet-nurse in Paris,
which is frequently done by the peasants of Morvan
and of other sections. As a matter of fact, hundreds of
marriage contracts contain such a provision.</p>

<p>For a period of some sixty years Morvan was one of
the poorest and most destitute provinces of France.
The soil was unyieldingly sterile and the climate cruel.
The people found it extremely difficult to subsist on
black bread alone, and the outlook for them seemed
gloomy enough, until the idea occurred to one of the
female Morvandelles—as they are called—to seek the
position of wet-nurse in Paris. After a time wet-nursing
became a means of livelihood for many peasant women,
an industry, so to speak. These women proved to be
the agents of civilization in the Morvan, and by degrees
they brought not only money there, but certain ideas of
luxury and of social propriety. The more intelligent
women, while pursuing their vocation among well-bred
and even distinguished families, acquired a certain refinement
of manner, and to them the little province owed
its increased prosperity and enlightenment. It is true,
the hard-earned money too often found its way into the
pockets of the wine-seller, who became the richest man
in the village in a short time; but times were better than
ever before in the Morvan, and the peasants rejoiced in
their good fortune.</p>

<p>In small provincial towns to which strangers seldom
come the inhabitants are all, or nearly all, related to each
other. For instance, Andoche claimed relationship with
everybody in the village. He professed to be a grand-nephew
of Jeannille Marselon; and as the villagers did
not deny it, he established his claims by virtue of the
axiom—“silence gives consent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Page 55]</span></p>

<p>He accompanied the procession on the invitation tour.
Perhaps his superfluous jollity was due to the fact that
he held in his arms a demijohn which Monsieur Eugène
had just presented to the betrothed. Having persuaded
Jacques Percier that he was fainting with thirst, the
future groom reluctantly consented to let Andoche test
the wine. Without further ceremony Andoche offered a
sip to everybody, extending his politeness so far as to
permit nobody to drink alone—which he said meant bad
luck.</p>

<p>By the time he reached Barrau’s cottage his spirits
were very much elevated and his dangerous tongue
wagged incessantly.</p>

<p>“Attention! Halt! Right about face!” he shouted
as Savin appeared at the door. The latter was pleased
at the spectacle, and his face brightened as he thought
what a pleasant diversion it would be for Catherine.</p>

<p>“Come in, Jacques,” said Savin, “and welcome,
Suzanne. Happy to see you all.”</p>

<p>The little party entered joyously, but the face of
Catherine froze the words upon their tongues, the smiles
upon their lips. Pale, stern, and relentless, she scarcely
replied to those who addressed her.</p>

<p>“She will bring bad luck upon us with that terrible
look,” thought Suzanne.</p>

<p>Jacques Percier spoke to Catherine, extending the
usual compliments and saying: “Madame Barrau, our
happiness will not be complete unless you are present
at our marriage. Will you accept a bonbon?”</p>

<p>He offered her the box. She stepped back a little.</p>

<p>“I thank you, Jacques,” said she. “May you be
happy as you deserve to be.”</p>

<p>A look of disappointment passed over his face, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Page 56]</span>
noticing it Catherine added: “It is not for me to accept
or to decline. I am not mistress here.”</p>

<p>“Then you, Monsieur Savin, will you not—” But
before Jacques had finished speaking Savin took two
<i>dragées</i> from the box, eating one and giving the other
to his wife.</p>

<p>“Catherine exaggerates,” said he. “There are some
things that a wife cannot do without consulting her
husband, but she accepts your invitation, I am sure, and
so do I, with pleasure. You will please accept from
me a roebuck—if Madame le Hausseur allows me to
kill one.”</p>

<p>Catherine bit her lips in mortification and vexation.
But Savin had broken the ice, and when he brought
out some fine old curaçoa the callers regaled themselves
freely and all became merry again.</p>

<p>As soon as they had gone Catherine said petulantly:
“You need no longer fear that I shall be too gay. I
could not be so if I tried.”</p>

<p>“I never objected to your having a good time—in a
proper way,” replied Barrau gently, but with an unmistakable
accent of firmness.</p>

<p>“But if I am not to dance it will be absurd for me to
go to the wedding.”</p>

<p>“Nobody will prevent you from dancing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so you say <i>to-day</i>; but when the time comes
you will be just as jealous as ever, and I shall have to
suffer for it.”</p>

<p>“Why talk so foolishly? You only weary me with
this useless discussion.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“But believe me, my child, a woman who will excite
her husband’s jealousy is either a coquette or a wilful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Page 57]</span>
vixen. It rests with you whether Suzanne’s wedding-day
shall be an agreeable one to us.”</p>

<p>“Agreeable! I suppose it would be so to you if I
neither raised my eyes, nor opened my mouth, nor
danced with Bruno, nor Firmin, nor Andoche, or any
young man whatsoever. But if old Father Mathieu, or
Grassy, or Monsieur the Mayor should be so good as
to invite me, then I may accept with alacrity. Bah!”</p>

<p>Savin, who had hoped to pave the way toward a reconciliation,
now saw the folly of the endeavor and replied
nothing. Whistling to Patachaud and taking his
gun, he left the house.</p>

<p>“What a wretched existence!” he muttered as he disappeared
under the frost-touched trees.</p>

<p>Left alone, Catherine raised her arms toward heaven
with an expression of utter despair. “<i>Mon Dieu!</i> how
dearly would I pay for freedom,” she cried.</p>

<p>Savin, on the other hand, soothed by the quiet atmosphere
of the woods, flattered himself that upon reflection
Catherine would understand the conciliatory
spirit which had prompted him to accept the wedding
invitation. The wedding would be a diversion for
Catherine, and he made up his mind not to dictate to or
upbraid her whatever she might do; even if she danced
with Bruno or Firmin, both of whom he disapproved.
He resolved to bring about a reconciliation if possible,
and he thought this little concession on his part would
accomplish it. Knowing his wife’s love for gayety, he
felt confident that a day’s unrestrained enjoyment would
dispel the cloud and restore her to good-nature once more.
And the brave-hearted fellow smiled to himself as he
thought of his home again blessed with peace and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Page 58]</span></p>

<p>On the narrow path which plunged down a steep declivity
into a ravine he encountered Fadard, the friend
of Andoche and the cousin of Mademoiselle Faillot.</p>

<p>The man was proceeding, with the assistance of his
cane, like a sober-minded citizen.</p>

<p>“Ah! it is Monsieur Fadard,” said Barrau; “and
where the devil did you come from?”</p>

<p>“From Dun les Places. I have cut across country, as
you see.”</p>

<p>The gamekeeper examined Fadard’s shoes and
trousers. They bore no traces of mud, and there were
swamps in the region of which he had spoken.</p>

<p>“And you are going to see Mademoiselle Faillot?”
asked Barrau.</p>

<p>“Just so,” returned Fadard.</p>

<p>Savin continued to question him in order to study him
the more closely. There seemed something suspicious
in the man’s movements. Why was he prowling about
this gloomy, forsaken spot, which bore an ill name
among the peasants and which most people avoided?
The trees were so dense that scarcely a bit of light
penetrated into the forest, and it was still and lonely
here on this chill autumn day. Fadard’s deceitful air
was obvious to Barrau, who faced him with a stern
countenance on which suspicion was plainly written.
Before this look Fadard’s eyes fell.</p>

<p>“At what time did you set out from Dun?”</p>

<p>“At two o’clock,” replied Fadard tartly.</p>

<p>“You must be a good walker to have come so far in
so short a time.”</p>

<p>As Barrau spoke he fancied he spied something concealed
under the other’s clothing. Fadard appeared
ill at ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Page 59]</span></p>

<p>“Another time,” continued Savin, “you had better
take the main road. One sometimes has a bad encounter
in such places as this.”</p>

<p>While speaking he put his hand familiarly on Fadard’s
shoulder. The latter lost countenance, and without reflecting
that he compromised himself in so doing, he
turned and fled.</p>

<p>“Ah! it seems that Monsieur Fadard has something
to conceal. And what cause has he to fear me, unless,
as I suspect, he is a poacher?”</p>

<p>His first thought was to chase the runaway, but he
abandoned the idea as useless. One might as well hunt
for a needle in a haystack as for a man in this wilderness.</p>

<p>“Never mind. He will come back again some day,
unless his cowardice gets the better of him.”</p>

<p>And smiling at the thought, Savin went on his way.</p>

		CHAPTER VIII.<br>
		<small>THE WEDDING.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>The day of Suzanne’s wedding came, bringing with it
no change for the better in the home of the Barraus.
Hostility still existed. Savin was as usual sad at heart,
and Catherine was visibly indifferent and disdainful.
She always dressed in excellent taste and in attire that,
however simple, accentuated her extraordinary beauty.
Formerly the D’Angerolles had known luxury and
affluence, and Catherine had inherited a becoming air
of stateliness. Her dignity and grace made her the
acknowledged belle of the province.</p>

<p>As Savin gazed upon her he could not conceal his admiration,
and gently laying his hand on her shoulder he
said: “Naughty little woman, you have no equal if
you would but consent to listen to reason.”</p>

<p>But Catherine remained mute and indifferent to his
caress. Savin courteously opened the door for her to
pass out, and soon they were on their way to the <i>fête</i>.</p>

<p>Any one seeing them as they walked together, he with
his military air and remarkable physique, and she enveloped
in a white mantle which set off her queenly
figure to the best advantage, would have been tempted
to exclaim: “What a fine couple!” as indeed they
were.</p>

<p>Before the blacksmith’s shop Fadard, with his hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Page 61]</span>
in his pockets, was whistling a hunter’s song. An expression
of malice dominated his features, but when the
Barraus passed by he saluted them with a smile that
succeeded in its attempt to be sarcastic.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Fadard,” returned Savin. “You
seem in better spirits than when I last saw you.”</p>

<p>Fadard said nothing, but he continued to smile in a
supercilious manner. Catherine glanced at him. Their
eyes met and the young woman read a sort of challenge
in his look. He was ready to go to the wedding, but he
was waiting for Andoche, who had not yet completed
his toilet.</p>

<p>“Bah! how I hate water,” muttered Andoche. “The
bother of going to <i>fêtes</i> is that one must souse in water.
I never drink the stuff and I heartily dislike to handle it.
Thank fortune, I am ready,” he said at length as he arranged
his necktie. “Let’s be off.”</p>

<p>In front of the conjugal cottage many of the guests
had assembled, and a bevy of boys and girls merrily
danced and frolicked on the green, while the old fogies,
calmly seated under the trees, discussed the frivolity
of the young and the wisdom of the old.</p>

<p>Within the cottage all was confusion. Nothing
seemed to be in place. The babel of voices and scampering
of feet were fairly deafening. The merrymakers
continued to arrive. Two or three ancient carry-alls,
weighted down with village boys and girls who were
shouting at the top of their voices, drove up and discharged
their load at the cottage door. Greetings and
embraces followed, and all gave themselves up to the
enjoyment of the hour.</p>

<p>The musicians finally came, and after drinking with
Andoche, all fell in line for the wedding-march to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Page 62]</span>
Mayor’s office. It was a pretty sight. Two hundred
guests, walking two by two, followed the bride. The
head of the little procession passed the house of Monsieur
Eugène before the last pair started.</p>

<p>A wedding in the provinces is considered a great
affair. The day is given over to enjoyment. Business
is suspended and the whole countryside joins in the
festivities. In this particular wedding every one was
interested, for the bride and groom were both popular
favorites. To be sure, many a girl thought Jacques a
simpleton to choose Suzanne, and many a lad declared
Suzanne was throwing herself away; but still the occasion
was a serene and happy one. The church service,
as well as the ceremony at the Mayor’s, was successfully
performed. During the former, Savin quietly stood
watching his wife, whose face was cold and joyless.</p>

<p>As they left the church a young fellow who had been
serving as kitchen-boy in Paris set off some fire-crackers
and hurled them down before the bridal party. The
village maidens were frightened at the noise and feared
their dresses would catch fire. But many laughed as,
accompanied by fireworks and listening to impromptu
jests, the procession returned to the cottage.</p>

<p>Near by, in the granary, a feast had been prepared.
Twenty good servants had been engaged to wait upon
the guests. Suzanne’s grandmother, a little woman
with bright, sharp eyes, superintended the banquet, and
a better table was never spread in the Morvan. The
old lady ordered the waiters about with a martial air.
As the party approached, she despatched one of her aids
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Ursule,” said she, “run to the kitchen and see if all
is ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Page 63]</span></p>

<p>The lusty, buxom girl addressed disappeared into
the adjoining apartment. And the kitchen! What a
poem! Half hidden by blue smoke and savory steam,
a dozen cooks were preparing the most tempting viands.
An ox was roasting. All kinds of game, meats, vegetables,
preserves, fruits, sweetmeats, <i>hors d’œuvres</i> and
spices were abundantly provided. Seven days of culinary
labor had been consumed in the preparation for the
banquet, and nothing had been left undone to make it
a success. An appetizing odor filled the air, and every
guest longed to begin the feast. Those in the village
who, in a spirit of economy, had declined the invitation—not
feeling inclined to contribute a present—now regretted
their action.</p>

<p>“How delicious and savory it smells,” said Mademoiselle
Faillot, who had declined the invitation. “Dear!
dear! if I had only known such a princely feast was to
be prepared, I certainly should have accepted. But
perhaps it is not yet too late. I will try.”</p>

<p>As the wedding party approached, she planted herself
in the road. She was an ugly-looking, avaricious,
cunning woman; but she knew well how to dissemble,
and as the bride advanced, her face was wreathed in
patronizing smiles.</p>

<p>“My dear Suzanne,” said she, “how beautiful you
are. I knew you would make a pretty bride, but you
are simply lovely—a hundred times beyond my expectations.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, Mademoiselle Léocadia,” returned
Suzanne, blushing with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. You far surpass our last bride, Jeanne,
in loveliness. And yet you know how everybody raved
about her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Page 64]</span></p>

<p>“How is it that you are not one of the merrymakers?”
asked Madame Percier, the groom’s mother.</p>

<p>“Well, I was afraid I should be obliged to go to
Château Chinon to-day; but my cousin did my errand
for me. If I had only known——”</p>

<p>“You would have accepted,” anticipated Suzanne.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you see I refused the <i>dragée</i>——”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind that,” said the bride graciously.
“Pray come to the banquet.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you kindly, but I made a stupid mistake,
and I must abide by it. I should have dearly loved
to see you beside Jacques and to have admired you in
the dance, but I must respect the custom in regard to
weddings.”</p>

<p>“The custom! Pooh! Come, come, Mademoiselle,
you must join us,” said Jacques as he gently took her
arm. “Here is Mademoiselle Léocadia who is going to
dine with us,” cried he to the rest. Mademoiselle Faillot
protested in a hypocritical manner, inwardly elated the
while at the success of her manœuvre.</p>

<p>Reaching the granary the tables were soon filled, and
Léocadia found herself occupying a seat of honor near
the bride and groom. Her flattery had proven effective,
as it usually did, and the day’s enjoyment was secured
to her. When, however, Suzanne’s grandmother saw
Mademoiselle Faillot so comfortably settled she looked
somewhat disappointed.</p>

<p>“I feared she would try to get in some way—the
viper,” was the old lady’s observation. But there was
nothing to be done about it.</p>

<p>The feast was a grand success. Everybody ate and
drank to his or her heart’s content, and the quantity of
wine consumed loosened the tongues of all present to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Page 65]</span>
such an extent that for a while the place was a very
good imitation of a pandemonium.</p>

<p>At length Suzanne rose and addressed the company.</p>

<p>“Who wants to dance?” she loudly inquired.</p>

<p>Immediately fifty boys and girls, among them Catherine,
Sidonie, Félicité, and Jeanne, pressed forward.</p>

<p>“My old grandmother danced at my marriage,” said
Grandma Marion, “and I will take a turn out of compliment
to my little Suzanne.”</p>

<p>And the agile, bright little old woman kept her
word, amid the applause of all present. Fadard, the
worse off for wine, approached Catherine to ask for the
first dance.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said he, “will you polka with me?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say, Monsieur. You must ask my husband.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, come.”</p>

<p>“You are surprised, it seems. Isn’t my husband the
master?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. But I supposed it hardly would be
necessary to ask permission for——”</p>

<p>“You were wrong, then.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will go and ask your husband.”</p>

<p>And turning on his heel, Andoche’s friend started in
quest of Savin, with a sinister expression on his face.</p>

		CHAPTER IX.<br>

	</h2>
</div>

<p>Savin was still sitting at the table. Though he had
finished eating and drinking he still remained there,
not wishing to move lest his wife should think he was
following her to spy upon her actions. Fadard had
the effrontery to accost him and ask permission to dance
with Catherine.</p>

<p>“Madame Barrau,” replied the gamekeeper, “is at
liberty to do as she pleases.”</p>

<p>Though he was daring by nature, Fadard thought it
wiser to make no reply, and he was turning to withdraw
when Andoche, flushed and besotted by a too senseless
indulgence in his “besetting sin,” seized him by the
lapel of his coat, saying: “<i>You</i> want to dance? Did
you say you were thinking of dancing, at your age? It
must have been a long time since you last looked in a
mirror—ha! ha! ha! So you want to dance, eh?”</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t I dance if I feel that way?”</p>

<p>“Fellow-citizens,” shouted Andoche in a high voice,
pointing to Fadard, “behold this gentleman. Is it not
a broad hint on the part of the ladies when they must
needs ask their husbands’ consent to dance with him?
And just to think of it—he doesn’t know people are
laughing at him. My friend, you had much better remain
in my society.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Page 67]</span></p>

<p>Strange as it appeared, Fadard did not resent the
blacksmith’s cutting remarks, and he offered no reply.
Doubtless his reasons were good for not wishing to antagonize
Andoche, or he certainly would have retaliated
there and then. He walked toward the dancing-room,
and rejoining Madame Barrau, acquainted her with
Savin’s answer.</p>

<p>“So you see, madame, you are at liberty to dance
with me or with another, just as you choose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” replied Catherine. “Not unless I am
legally authorized to do so.”</p>

<p>“You must be jesting.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed I am not.”</p>

<p>“But, believe me, Monsieur Barrau declared you are
free to dance whenever you please.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that is not sufficient. Go back and bid
him express himself in due form of the law. His response,
I fear, was illegal.”</p>

<p>Fadard intently regarded Catherine for a moment, but
she so defiantly returned his gaze that he was perplexed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she added, “he was only making a fool
of you.”</p>

<p>“You are, at all events,” he rejoined.</p>

<p>“Well!”</p>

<p>“Take care, my little woman. It will cost you dear
to make fun of Fadard.”</p>

<p>“You should say that to my husband. But perhaps it
is only in dealing with women that you are so brave.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! I would as soon tackle Monsieur Barrau as
anybody else,” cried Fadard, with rising anger. “Only
let me find him in a tight corner——”</p>

<p>“Who?” thundered Savin from behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Page 68]</span></p>

<p>“Enough! We shall see,” answered Fadard as he
sneaked away like a whipped cur.</p>

<p>Catherine quickly apprised the other girls of Fadard’s
discomfiture. To hide his embarrassment, Fadard hastened
to ask Jenny Fourès for the next dance. The
merriest, liveliest girl in the whole province was Jenny,
and the name of “Madcap” just suited her.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” said she, “it seems to me you are not
very polite.”</p>

<p>“How so, Mademoiselle?” asked Fadard.</p>

<p>“When a gentleman asks for a dance he takes off his
cap, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>Fadard smiled. In the provinces the peasants, as a
rule, wear little skull-caps not unlike the Turkish fez,
and in a dance they lend a rather picturesque effect. It
is the custom to touch the cap, without removing it,
when a man is asking for the pleasure of a dance. But
Jenny’s rebuke did not disconcert the gay Fadard in the
least. He bowed low, took off his cap, and again besought
her for a dance.</p>

<p>A burst of laughter greeted his gallantry.</p>

<p>“I am indeed honored, Monsieur,” remarked Jenny
coquettishly, “but I cannot dance without my father’s
permission. Go and ask him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Madcap, you are joking. Come.”</p>

<p>But she would not listen. She disappeared in the
crowd; while the chagrined Fadard addressed another
girl, who in a similar way answered: “Go and ask my
brother, Monsieur Fadard.”</p>

<p>Fadard by this time was furious. Not only was he
deprived of a partner, but he evidently was unpopular
among the village girls. He resolved to make one more
attempt, and turning to Rosalie he asked for a dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Page 69]</span></p>

<p>“With pleasure, Monsieur, upon one condition.”</p>

<p>“You mean I must ask somebody’s permission, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. I shall be delighted to dance with you if
you will kindly tell me your age.”</p>

<p>His age was a tender point with Fadard, and he
turned toward the offender with a menacing gesture.
Just at that moment Rosalie’s elderly husband, who,
though henpecked at home, was still the possessor of a
brawny pair of arms abroad, quickly settled the matter
by administering a severe fistic correction which landed
Fadard in a corner, panting for breath.</p>

<p>Recovering himself, the coward rushed off to relate
his woes to Andoche, hoping that the latter in his intoxicated
condition would take his part and avenge his
wrongs.</p>

<p>But Andoche just then was enjoying himself too well
to be beguiled into a quarrel and an encounter. So
Fadard seated himself beside Andoche, who urged him
to drown his grievances in the flowing bowl.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dancing had begun. Nearly every one
was thus engaged but Catherine. She obstinately refused
to participate in it. If Fadard thought he alone was
the victim of her caprice he was mistaken. Resolved to
pose as a martyr to her husband’s whims, she treated each
new-comer with the same answer, and many thinking she
did not wish to dance with them, sought other partners.
Some, however, took her at her word. Bruno would
have given his life to have held her in his arms, but she
gave him the same response, and he went away in despair,
poor Sidonie watching him with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, that he could be consoled with one who would
die for his happiness,” she murmured to herself, not
daring to speak to him openly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Page 70]</span></p>

<p>After Bruno nearly all of the young men besought
her, but Catherine returned the one answer to them:
“You must ask my husband’s permission.”</p>

<p>Firmin, taking her <i>au serieux</i>, went to Savin, who by
this time was thoroughly vexed and who retorted to the
young man not a little harshly.</p>

<p>Savin was most disgusted at his wife’s conduct. Instead
of profiting by this occasion to settle their differences,
Catherine played a disagreeable and unexpected
<i>rôle</i>. One by one the young men sought him out to ask
permission to dance with his wife. It became a painful
persecution to him; but when, at length, he divined her
intention he decided to make as light of the situation as
possible.</p>

<p>“How stupid you are,” said he to the young men.
“Don’t you see that Catherine is only joking you?”</p>

<p>But the farce continued. Each moment brought
a fresh applicant and Savin’s patience was about exhausted.
Besides, he felt that his wife was making a
fool of him, and that everybody was amused at the little
comedy being acted by Catherine and himself. To be
made a laughing-stock for the sake of his charming
spouse he could not endure. Everybody felt more or
less oppressed by the heat of the room and excited by
the wine, and the gamekeeper was by no means an exception.
Irritated beyond forbearance, Savin approached
his wife and bade her to get ready to go home. Then
he added: “You do not wish a reconciliation, it seems.
Very well.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you have some complaint to make against
me right here,” remarked Catherine, with a provoking
air.</p>

<p>Savin felt himself the object of a hundred eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Page 71]</span></p>

<p>“I have no desire to pass for a fool whose wife may
ridicule him at will.”</p>

<p>“You will always pass for just what you are.”</p>

<p>“Catherine, pray do not get in a passion here.”</p>

<p>The young woman looked crestfallen and feigned
fear. She hypocritically looked to the right and to the
left, as though seeking protection and as though afraid
of violence from her husband.</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed,” exclaimed Mademoiselle
Faillot, coming up at that moment, “to treat a woman
in such a manner.”</p>

<p>“Please do not meddle in my affairs, Mademoiselle.
I do not accuse you of your little peccadilloes, nor do I
<i>ask how you dispense the money intrusted to you for the
babes of wet-nurses that you have in charge</i>.”</p>

<p>“What! What is that?” shouted the old spinster,
turning crimson with rage.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle, when one has a cousin like Fadard,
one need have no uneasiness.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed. Not so a man who has married the
daughter of a criminal.”</p>

<p>The young bride now interposed. “Mademoiselle,”
she said, “you were not invited—at the last moment—to
insult my friends.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Then your friends should not make any
such insinuations.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if I had a husband like other husbands,” broke
in Catherine, “all would go well.”</p>

<p>For an instant Savin was beside himself. To intimate
that he was disturbing the festivities was more
than the mildest of men could endure. Had he not
submitted for over two hours to everything disagreeable
for her sake? Besides, had not that Mademoiselle Faillot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Page 72]</span>
insulted his wife? And then Catherine—his own wife—had
as much as declared that he was responsible for this
disgraceful scene.</p>

<p>His brain was on fire with indignation. A few friends
approached and endeavored to calm him, but in vain.
He stepped toward his wife with a furious gesture.
He was determined that she should leave the place.
Bruno, observing his threatening attitude, bounded with
rage toward the gamekeeper.</p>

<p>“You are a coward!” he fairly yelled, laying hold of
Barrau’s collar.</p>

<p>Surprised and still more incensed, Savin took a backward
step, prepared to grapple with the young fellow.
A terrible struggle seemed imminent, for Barrau was a
powerful, vigorous man, and L’Ours was not here to
defend Bruno this time. But Sidonie was, and the love
she had for her hero made her brave to defend him.</p>

<p>“Are you mad?” she cried, as she seized Bruno’s arm
and dragged him away. Barrau did not follow, as every
spectator thought he would. He turned toward his
wife, and taking her arm pushed her forward.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, sternly, “let us end this wretched
row. We will go home.”</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, but just as the two
reached the door Fadard impertinently and loudly exclaimed:
“Well, that is what you get for inviting common
people.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he uttered these words when he was
dealt hard blow on the cheek by Savin. Smarting
with pain, Fadard threw himself upon the gamekeeper,
but the latter adroitly warded off his fist and with one
movement left his antagonist knocked senseless on the
floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Page 73]</span></p>

<p>Once more Barrau, with Catherine by his side, started
for home. On the face of one was written sullen determination;
on that of the other bitter despair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile old Jeannille Marselon, her hands crossed
on her breast, looked like a being from another world.
Her eyes were transfixed and her long, lank, sallow face
seemed cold as marble—a face on which the closest observer
could not have discovered a sign of sensation or
emotion.</p>

		CHAPTER X.<br>
		<small>CONFESSIONS.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Sidonie, panting for breath but still determined, did
not stop until she had led Bruno behind the little hedge
back of the cottage. Then, astonished at her own temerity,
she began to be conscious of a feeling of bewildered
embarrassment. What would they think of her?</p>

<p>Ah, in this desperate way she had confessed her love
before the world—and all for one who did not reciprocate
her affection. Oh, the shame of it! What should
she do or say?</p>

<p>Until now Bruno himself had not guessed her secret.
He had regarded her as a kind and faithful friend—nothing
more. At the same time he felt that he had
betrayed his secret, and he too was confused and silent.
Neither dreamed of speaking, and but this one thought
possessed their minds: “I have proclaimed my unrequited
love to the world.”</p>

<p>About to go away, Sidonie raised her eyes and saw
Bruno’s sad, despairing face. Pity filled her soul.</p>

<p>“You are unhappy, Bruno,” she tenderly said, extending
her hand in sympathy, at whose readiness the
astonished Bruno burst into sobs. The pretty little
cripple’s heart sank and tear-drops wet her long lashes.</p>

<p>“Oh, why—why do you love her so much?” she asked
bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Page 75]</span></p>

<p>Bruno understood the reproach and jealousy that
prompted the question.</p>

<p>“Can I help it?” he said impulsively. “Am I the
master of my own heart?”</p>

<p>“You are bewitched,” she replied, with a shudder.</p>

<p>“Yes, there are moments when I feel powerless.”</p>

<p>“You wish, then, you were free from this thraldom?
You wish that you had never met her?”</p>

<p>“I do indeed. But since I know her I must love
her.”</p>

<p>Sidonie was again tempted to go. It was agony to
hear him speak thus of another. And yet how cowardly
to run away! No, she must summon the courage to
endure it.</p>

<p>“My good Sidonie,” continued Bruno, “how patient
you are—how sympathetic.”</p>

<p>“How long have you loved her?” ventured Sidonie.</p>

<p>“Even before she married Savin. But I never dared
to tell her so. It was like this, Sidonie: One day I was
fishing in the Trinquelin brook and she came down in
the neighboring field. Let me see, that was four
months previous to the death of her father—and you
know as well as I that Monsieur d’Angerolles was never
guilty of crime. The accusation against him was all a
network of lies.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, go on,” insisted Sidonie.</p>

<p>“She came into the meadow, as I said, and we joked
together over the fence, and finally she said she would
try her luck at fishing for a while. We cut some willow
rods, and taking the bait and tackle we proceeded along
the stream, at intervals casting our lines in little babbling
pools and watching, with interest, for a bite.”</p>

<p>“And were you successful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Page 76]</span></p>

<p>“No. In the places where I cast there did not appear
the sign of a fish.”</p>

<p>“And Catherine?”</p>

<p>“Nearly every time her bait was taken, and I helped
her unhook at least a dozen fish.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, Bruno, she has a sorcerer’s power——”</p>

<p>“No, no. She had in her pocket a little bottle of
pistachio, belonging to her father, and she put some of
the essence on the frog bait, without my knowing it.
You know pistachio attracts crabs.”</p>

<p>“And were you not jealous of her success?”</p>

<p>“No. I was only ashamed of my failure.”</p>

<p>“And what did she say?”</p>

<p>“She only laughed. We went on down the stream,
and had a merry time; but, Sidonie, promise that you
will never repeat what I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Is it, then, so bad?”</p>

<p>“No; but I do not wish it to be known. If it should
get back to Catherine she might be offended.”</p>

<p>Sidonie, with a sad smile, replied: “Do not fear, I
am not a tattler.”</p>

<p>“You promise?”</p>

<p>“I promise, Bruno.”</p>

<p>“Well, while Catherine was trying to extricate her
hook from a stump the overhanging branch to which she
was clinging gave way. She slipped and fell into the
stream. The water was deep at that place and the current
strong. Realizing her danger, I plunged in after
her.”</p>

<p>“How foolish!”</p>

<p>“Just as I jumped in Catherine rose to the surface,
and I seized her dress. We were instantly whirled
among the rocks, but I protected her as well as I could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Page 77]</span>
and by grasping the rocks kept our heads above water
as we rushed down stream. In the mad race of the current
we were borne along until an enormous rock in the
middle of the stream offered me one chance of escape.
With great difficulty I managed to climb up on the rock
with my burden. Catherine’s face was as white as
death. In this wood where the stream had carried us I
could see on the left an open space, and by picking my
way from the big rock to smaller ones that at stepping
distances reached to the bank, I was soon able to place
her on the cool grass. Presently she revived. Her lids
fluttered and then opened, and for the first time I was
thrilled by her incomparable beauty.”</p>

<p>Sidonie trembled, but she asked him to continue.</p>

<p>“And then, because without my assistance she probably
would have drowned, I began to feel very near
to her. However, I did not really love her <i>then</i>, but
she appealed to me. We were drenched, of course,
and the heat of the sun was not sufficient to dry our
clothing; but we were obliged to wait there until Catherine
felt a little stronger. Finally, she rose, looked
at me for several seconds, and then silently put her
two arms around my neck, and then——”</p>

<p>Bruno abruptly paused, showing himself to be ill at
ease. Just then a little leaf falling, irresolutely, from a
branch, at last reached the ground. Sidonie’s eyes followed
its course. A question came to her lips, but she
dared not ask it. At the same time Bruno was wondering
if he had not said too much. He did not wish to compromise
Catherine; but confession is good for the soul,
and he could not resist the impulse to give utterance to
his pent-up feelings.</p>

<p>“Well, she kissed me twice, and then I knew——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Page 78]</span></p>

<p>Again he paused. But an instant afterward he said:
“She went away, leaving me all the fish.”</p>

<p>“She was always a little bold, I think,” observed
Sidonie, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>“No, do not say that. Would you not have done the
same had I saved your life?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted poor Sidonie to herself.</p>

<p>“But,” pursued Bruno, “it would have been far better
for me had she simply thanked me.”</p>

<p>“You realize it, Bruno?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for from that time I have been wretched.”</p>

<p>“But she is married.”</p>

<p>“I know it, my good Sidonie. But still I love her—I
love her! But I am only a peasant and——”</p>

<p>“And what does that matter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do not know how to address her in language
worthy of her or of my love. I can only stupidly say,
I love her.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Sidonie, pathetically, “I should not ask
for more.”</p>

<p>“You—you! Perhaps not. But, don’t you see, with
her it is different. She is not a peasant by birth or
education.”</p>

<p>Sidonie suffered keenly. Each word of Bruno’s
stabbed her tender heart. She felt that she must leave
him. She longed to be alone. And yet something held
her rooted to the spot. All that Bruno had said in regard
to Catherine was but kindred to the feeling the
lame girl possessed for him.</p>

<p>“Oh,” continued Bruno, “could you but know what
it is to love as I do! It is a fever which consumes one!
It is torture! Catherine! Catherine! What would I
not do for you? For you I would confront a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Page 79]</span>
dangers; for you I would lay down my life; for
you——”</p>

<p>“Be silent!” shouted Sidonie, beside herself.</p>

<p>“Who,” he went on, not heeding her command,
“can compare with her in loveliness? Who is her
equal? I would defend her against her husband! I
could kill Firmin did I not know her indifference to him.
If at this moment she were to say, ‘Lie at my feet
until you die of love,’ I should eagerly obey.”</p>

<p>Unable at this moment to control herself, Sidonie
seized his hands, and covering them with passionate
kisses, exclaimed: “And I adore you—even as you
adore her.”</p>

<p>And turning away she disappeared, leaving Bruno
utterly stupefied. When at last he realized the situation,
he was overpowered. His words must have
seemed so cruel to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, how miserable it all is! Poor, poor Sidonie!
How I must have wounded her loyal heart. Oh, why—why
could I not have loved her instead of Catherine?
We might have been so happy! and now only misery
awaits us.”</p>

		CHAPTER XI.<br>
		<small>TEMPTATION.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Bruno possessed an ardent poetic nature. In his boyhood
he was a day-dreamer. While his village comrades
ravaged birds’ nests, played at leap-frog, and in
other ways distinguished themselves for mischief, he was
wandering alone by the river lost in revery. With his
feet buried in the cool ripples, he loved to watch the
water and study the habits of the finny tribes as they
played about him.</p>

<p>He knew where the trout made a home under the
rocks, and in the cool summer evenings, with his legs
bared to the thigh, he would surprise them in their hiding-places
and then a wild chase would follow. How
many times would his hand close over some little creature,
only to find the next moment that it had slipped
from his fingers and escaped among the pebbles.</p>

<p>As he grew into a tall, graceful boy of fifteen, however,
he began to think how he could best serve Mother
Mathurine, and with a good will he went to work. But
most of his leisure time was devoted to trout-fishing and
he became an expert angler. Many a fine string of
trout bore witness to his skill, and the people of the village
looked to him for a supply when a present of that
nature was to be made for a <i>fête</i> or a social party.</p>

<p>“Bruno’s trout always have the best flavor,” once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Page 81]</span>
remarked Andoche, “and I do not understand how he
coaxes them to bite.”</p>

<p>And now Bruno was grown to manhood.</p>

<p>One morning toward the end of November, after a
successful expedition, the result of which was a fine trout
of enormous size, Bruno was returning home by way of
a secluded path through the woods, dreaming of his love
for Catherine, when he met the object of his thoughts
face to face.</p>

<p>The gamekeeper’s wife involuntarily stopped. Bruno’s
face changed color. At this moment Jacques Percier
made his appearance. He quickly passed by, but
just as he was about to disappear behind a hedge of walnut
trees he turned and saw the gamekeeper’s wife still
standing in front of Bruno. Knowing Bruno’s mad
infatuation for Catherine, Jacques fancied he had
stumbled upon a rendezvous, and the stupid fellow hid
himself behind the trees to watch proceedings.</p>

<p>Catherine approached closer to Bruno.</p>

<p>“You are a brave defender,” said she, referring to his
action on the day of Suzanne’s wedding.</p>

<p>“No, Madame—oh, no. It was nothing. Why do
you say that?”</p>

<p>“You know perfectly well, Bruno,” she replied. “Ah,
if you had only told me your sentiments before my
marriage.”</p>

<p>Bruno tremblingly whispered: “Do not speak like
that, Catherine, for we know not what may happen.”</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t I say it? I express a regret.
If I only had known then what I know now.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you know——”</p>

<p>“I know that you were exposed to death for my sake
that day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Page 82]</span></p>

<p>“O Madame, surely you exaggerate.”</p>

<p>“At all events, I must admire your heroism. I know
that at Suzanne’s reception you tried to defend me
against the man I have married. And you do not wish
me to reproach myself for not having guessed your
secret? Alas! the past cannot be changed, but if I
were your wife——”</p>

<p>“I beg of you, be silent! I shall go mad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I too am miserable. Still, that shall not prevent
me from thanking you.”</p>

<p>She extended her hand. Poor Bruno knew not what
to do.</p>

<p>“It is not necessary to speak of the little I have
done. It was but selfishness on my part.”</p>

<p>Catherine, who was silent for a moment, decided to
change the subject.</p>

<p>“You have there a fine fish,” she said, for want of a
better theme.</p>

<p>“Will you not accept it, Madame?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, my poor friend, no. What should I do
with it? Should I not be obliged to tell <i>him</i> where I
got it?”</p>

<p>Him! That word strangely impressed Bruno. For
the second time she had designated her husband without
speaking his name, as though the sound were odious to
her.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he said. “Take the trout, please. It
will give me great pleasure if you will.”</p>

<p>But Catherine refused. However, she did not pass
on. From time to time she made a motion as though
about to speak. Her eyes were brighter than usual, and
a flush suffused her cheek. Bruno, supposing she had
something important to say, waited patiently. But soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Page 83]</span>
her expression changed. She looked at the young man
long and earnestly. Then, as though renouncing some
idea as untimely or impracticable, she briefly said:
“Adieu, Bruno.”</p>

<p>“Adieu,” he returned, with a sigh.</p>

<p>They were about to separate, when, with an impulsive
gesture, Catherine turned resolutely and whispered in
his ear: “Do you love me, Bruno?”</p>

<p>In answer, Bruno, seizing her hand, muttered a few
unintelligible words.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Bruno,” persisted Catherine, wishing a
coherent reply, “do you love me?”</p>

<p>After all that she had said concerning her husband,
and after all the regret she had manifested, this question
amounted to a confession. Bruno took her passionately
in his arms and rained kisses on her face.</p>

<p>“Then,” she continued, with a greater show of reserve,
“what if I ask of you something?”</p>

<p>“You have need of me!” cried Bruno in ecstasy.
“Oh, speak, Madame; you have only to command. I
am eager to do your bidding.”</p>

<p>“Even wrong?”</p>

<p>“Even wrong—for your sake.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you say that because you are excited, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Ah, do not doubt me. Believe me, you have only
to command, Madame Catherine.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” she began, but she stopped short, lost
in thought. “Bruno,” she went on finally, “go away
from me. Leave me at once, for I am utterly miserable.”</p>

<p>“No—not until I know what I can do for you.”</p>

<p>But Catherine was now unwilling to say another word.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Page 84]</span>
Remorse, or shame, or both had subdued her first wild
thought and she was silent. Meanwhile Bruno was urging
her to divulge what she desired him to do. So
long and so earnestly did he entreat her to speak, that
at last she muttered a few words in his ear.</p>

<p>The poor fellow grew deathly white and withdrew a
step in terror. His eyes were fixed upon those of Catherine,
which glittered like steel. In a moment a cry
escaped his lips. Letting the trout fall upon the
ground, he lifted his arms and ran across the fields—not
knowing what he did.</p>

<p>Quite as troubled as he, Catherine unconsciously extended
her arms as though to call him back. But he
did not look behind him, and she too soon disappeared
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>What horrible proposition had Catherine made to
Bruno? Cannot the reader imagine?</p>

<p>Since the wedding of Jacques Percier and Suzanne,
life had been all but unendurable in the pretty little cottage
at the corner of the wood. Savin, convinced that
his wife no longer loved him, experienced the countless
pangs of ruined affection. Catherine had continued to
pose as a martyr and he had persecuted her until she
was indeed to be pitied. He had brutally resolved to
give her cause to complain. He had exacted that the
house should be irreproachably neat and orderly, and
that the meals should be ready precisely on the hour.
The breach had widened day by day. Savin had become
more rude and Catherine more irreconcilable. They
had addressed each other only in terms of hatred or
anger. Nearly every day there had been disagreeable
scenes between the two.</p>

<p>“Do not force me to use violence,” said Barrau savagely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Page 85]</span>
one day, at which remark Catherine was naturally
indignant. Both were at love’s antipodes. All peace
was at an end, and the more Catherine reflected the
more she felt that nothing but her husband’s death
could bring relief. And having an overwhelming desire
to confide in somebody, she had thought of Bruno. But
now she perceived how revolting it must have been to
his noble mind. The words she had spoken had stunned
and driven him away. However, she would not have
told Bruno had he not urged, nay begged, her to do so.
He had presumed, of course, that she was going to propose
an elopement, and while that would have been a
serious undertaking, he felt able to brave all for her.
Once far away from St. Benoit, he had dreamed of
working for Catherine and devoting himself to her happiness.</p>

<p>But when he heard the young woman proposing to
kill Savin he could scarcely trust his ears, and we already
have seen with what fear he fled from her. Like
most of the peasants, Bruno was a very good marksman.
He could handle a gun with considerable skill, and the
idea had occurred to Catherine to address him just as she
would have made the same proposition, under similar
circumstances, to Firmin, Fadard, or even to Andoche,
if the latter ever had had a thought for anything but the
bottle. But Bruno was desperately in love with her and
professedly willing to die for her sake. But she did not
know that Bruno would sooner cut off his right hand
or tear out his heart than lie in wait for an honest man
to kill him. Not even for love’s sake could he resort to
treachery and villainy.</p>

<p>Noticing how Bruno received her terrible suggestion,
she had been moved to contrition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Page 86]</span></p>

<p>“He did right to leave me in dismay, the honest fellow,”
she had said as she entered the cottage. “I
could embrace him for refusing. Who knows but that
he may save my life a second time? Brave Bruno!”</p>

<p>Then her proposition in all its hideous blackness recurred
to her. Her past life loomed up before her mind’s
eye and mercilessly mocked and shamed her, and as
she meditated—for the first time—she admitted to herself
that she had been to blame from the day of the
raspberry <i>fête</i> up to the time of Suzanne’s marriage.
The crime she had contemplated now seemed <i>impish</i>
and terrible. She repented of her wicked thoughts and
thanked God that Bruno’s conduct had created in her
this feeling, otherwise she might never have taken a
step toward reconciliation.</p>

<p>Savin was in the forest. She now awaited him with
some impatience. Courageously she made up her mind
to tender the first advances and bring back her husband’s
smile. All bickering should cease. The abyss
on the verge of which Bruno’s flight had arrested her
now seemed so dark and horrible. She would a thousand
times rather endure the jeers of Rosalie and of the
rest than ever again give way to such demon thoughts.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, I will make amends for all the harm I have
done,” she mentally resolved as she busied herself about
the supper.</p>

<p>Barrau had gone to <i>Pierre qui Vire</i>. A legend is associated
with this place respecting the old Balance Rock.
This rock leans against another in such a way as to form
a perfect balance, and the story goes that each day
when the town-clock at Vaumarin, a little village perched
upon the opposite mountain, strikes twelve, the rock
turns over three times. But some very precise people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Page 87]</span>
affirm that there is no town-clock at Vaumarin to strike
the hour, and so the legend suffers. Others, however,
declare that at midnight the rock, possessed of the devil,
slowly turns three times. Many excursions are made to
the place to watch the mysterious rock, especially by
those who are not in the least afraid of goblins. A
more lonely, dreary spot on earth could not be found.
The rock is situated some three miles from any human
habitation, in the midst of a dense and gloomy forest.
All the paths leading to it are lined with deep ravines,
some of them of frightful depth and filled with a mass
of tangled roots and projecting bowlders. Just at the
foot of Balance Rock an avalanche of stones has fallen,
and these from time to time tumble headlong over
the precipice with a thunderous crash. In awful confusion
lie the rocks, forming such weird shapes as
in the night are enough to fill with dread the bravest
heart.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the gorge, in a rock-formed bed,
rush the torrents of the Trinquelin River—as though to
shun the grewsome spot. But amid these most solitary
and desolate surroundings a convent stands on the granite
rocks. A misanthropic priest founded it some twenty-five
years ago, imposing on its members a code of
rules so severe that several died within the first twelve
months, and finally the code was somewhat modified.
In winter there always is great suffering within its walls,
but in the summer-time it is comfortable as well as
beautiful.</p>

<p>Savin, walking along the river bank in the thick underbrush,
was a prey to bitter reflections. The cold,
cheerless day did not tend to lighten his mood. He
felt that his whole life was a failure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Page 88]</span></p>

<p>“Happiness is but a chimera,” he said, “a myth to
dream about, but not to realize.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a gunshot echoed through the ravine from
rock to rock. A ball whizzed past his ear. He raised
his rifle and garrisoned himself behind a rock. But at
that moment a cunning little doe, wounded and bleeding,
fell at his feet with a moan. There was a crackling of
leaves. A well-directioned jump landed a man near his
victim, which after a spasm or two was dead.</p>

<p>“So it is that rascal,” muttered Savin as he stood
gazing at Firmin, who stooped to pick up his game.</p>

<p>“You seem to own everything about this region,”
Savin said ironically.</p>

<p>Firmin, surprised at the gamekeeper’s presence, made
a backward leap.</p>

<p>“It’s no use. You may as well surrender,” added
Savin sternly.</p>

<p>Firmin was about to make a break for the woods,
when Savin raised his rifle.</p>

<p>“If you take two more steps you are a dead man,” he
coolly warned.</p>

<p>Firmin stopped.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you do not know,” continued Savin, “that
it is a grave offence to kill the females.”</p>

<p>“Well, make your complaint,” growled Firmin.</p>

<p>Savin took a step forward, grasped the poacher by
the collar, and went on: “To speak candidly, I have
more to complain of than the mere loss of a doe. For
more than three months now, thanks to your impudence
and vanity, I have been deprived of contentment. You
have been the cause of my misfortune.”</p>

<p>“Who says so?”</p>

<p>“I do, and my word has never been doubted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Page 89]</span></p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” asked Firmin, who, as we
know, was not a lion in the way of courage.</p>

<p>“We are alone, entirely alone,” pursued Barrau, with
awful complacence, “and we will settle this matter
right here. You have been paying court to my
wife.”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“You would deny it? You are afraid I will kill you,
eh? Well, you have reason to fear. Who will prevent
me if I wish to do so? You have been caught poaching—and
I am a gamekeeper. There is the proof of your
guilt,” pointing to the doe. “And I should only have
to accuse you of having fired at me. Self-defence
would be my plea. What judge would hesitate to acquit
me—to congratulate me?”</p>

<p>While speaking Savin held his rifle in readiness.
Pale and trembling, Firmin looked about as though invoking
aid.</p>

<p>“But reassure yourself,” observed Savin, lowering his
rifle. “I am not an assassin. You have wounded and
disgraced me, however, and I cannot let it pass; so I
have a proposition to make.”</p>

<p>Firmin breathed more freely. Since Barrau was not
going to kill him what had he to worry about? Raising
his head proudly, he said: “Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“They say you have been a <i>valet de chambre</i> in the
city and know something about the polite doings of
society. If that is true, you must know what a duel is.
My rifle is loaded and you have ammunition. Load
your weapon and we will fight.”</p>

<p>The challenge did not seem to frighten Firmin.
Surely, he thought, Savin will not insist.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” queried Firmin curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Page 90]</span></p>

<p>“We will take position fifty paces apart, and then
each may take ten steps forward before firing.”</p>

<p>“But that is not a duel,” said Firmin solemnly.</p>

<p>“Then choose a better course; but be quick about it.”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to fight at all,” replied the poacher.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” exclaimed Barrau, with an effort to contain
himself.</p>

<p>“No, I do not. You have mentioned your wife.
Well, if she is indiscreet you must take better care of
her. I am not to blame, and why should I expose myself
to death when I have accumulated a neat little sum
to enjoy after working hard for eighteen months? No,
indeed, I am not such a fool.”</p>

<p>“You coward! Heavens! what a craven you are!”</p>

<p>Firmin’s head drooped and he blushed. Then he
rallied.</p>

<p>“But,” said he, “it would be no duel without witnesses.”</p>

<p>“I expected you would find some excuse,” said Barrau
impatiently. “Perhaps you prefer a duel with swords.
Schemer! You want to get away and then mock me.
But that will not work. You must fight.”</p>

<p>“I say no. If I wounded you or killed you, I should
be branded as an assassin. No, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then; I shall be obliged to kill you outright.”</p>

<p>Savin again raised his rifle, and Firmin was again terrified.
Nightfall was not far off, and to be murdered in
this ghostly spot was a horrible thought.</p>

<p>It was appallingly obvious to Firmin that he was in
Barrau’s power. Nothing would prevent the latter
from proving his innocence should he carry out his
threat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Page 91]</span></p>

<p>Approaching Firmin, Savin seized him by the collar
and shook him violently.</p>

<p>“Will you fight?”</p>

<p>Firmin began to cry for help. Savin, who intended
only to give him a thorough scare, now proceeded to
administer a rather vigorous chastisement. At length,
when he concluded he had taught the lesson to its completion
he stopped. But anon he acted as though about
to repeat it, Firmin meanwhile fairly quaking with fear.
Then, turning on his heel, Savin walked away, leaving
Firmin prostrate on the ground.</p>

<p>As soon as the gamekeeper was lost to sight in the
woods Firmin, with a muttered curse, seized the doe and
went his way. Hatred burned in his breast, and it was
depicted on every lineament of his wicked face. His
thirst for vengeance was consuming him.</p>

		CHAPTER XII.<br>
		<small>A VILLAIN’S OFFER.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Irritated beyond expression, Savin proceeded homeward,
and, as it happened, the first man he met was
Andoche—about a mile from St. Benoit.</p>

<p>The blacksmith was a little the worse for liquor, but
that was by no means a novelty in him.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he remarked, as he and Barrau came
face to face, “I see you have two guns. Have you been
capturing somebody?”</p>

<p>“Better than that,” returned Savin, whose anger
increased the more he recalled his recent experience.</p>

<p>“Oh, with what have you regaled him? For I will
wager it is Firmin’s rifle.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, Andoche. And permit me to add that
your friend Firmin is the biggest coward in the
country.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> Have you just discovered that?”</p>

<p>“I did not know that such a craven existed on the
face of the earth. No.”</p>

<p>“How did you find it out at last?”</p>

<p>“I was down at Balance Rock, and he killed a young
doe under my very nose.”</p>

<p>“A doe? Indeed that is a crime. And so you got
angry and thumped him without further ceremony, eh?”</p>

<p>“No; but I demanded satisfaction.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Page 93]</span></p>

<p>“<i>À propos</i> of what?”</p>

<p>“Of my wife,” replied Savin, laconically.</p>

<p>At that moment Jacques Percier, with his usual stupid
demeanor, came across the fields and joined them. He
heard Barrau’s last words, and quite naturally inferred
that Bruno also figured in the subject of conversation.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon, gentlemen,” said he, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Good-afternoon, Percier.”</p>

<p>“Your wife!” repeated the blacksmith in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes. You know she is indiscreet. I do not for a
moment believe anything further; but she is imprudent
and I am greatly disturbed by it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are too hard upon her.”</p>

<p>“No, I only ask her love and respect.”</p>

<p>“Well,” interposed Jacques, with the pompous air of
a bridegroom, “we all expect that.”</p>

<p>“At all events, I have given the rascal a good lesson.”</p>

<p>“And he deserved it,” replied Jacques, thinking all
the time Savin was speaking of Bruno.</p>

<p>In a voice vibrating with anger, Barrau then related
the details of the occurrence at Balance Rock, not, however,
mentioning Firmin’s name, since Andoche knew of
whom he was speaking.</p>

<p>In the mean time, one by one, the little group increased.
Other peasants listened to Savin’s story.
When he had finished Jacques Percier, with his great
globe-like eyes fixed upon Barrau’s face, foolishly
asked: “Then you, too, saw them embrace each
other?”</p>

<p>Barrau sprang forward in a frenzy. “Where?
When?” he cried.</p>

<p>Andoche slyly touched Jacques’s foot, and the latter
saw his mistake. But Savin, taking him savagely by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Page 94]</span>
the collar, shouted: “Did you see him embrace my
wife?”</p>

<p>“Don’t strangle me,” cried Percier. “It isn’t my
fault if Madame Catherine——”</p>

<p>“Answer me,” insisted Barrau, shaking Jacques violently.
“Answer me! Did you see them embrace?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes! There!”</p>

<p>“You must be mistaken,” interposed Andoche.</p>

<p>“Let him explain, if you please,” requested Savin.
“When was this?”</p>

<p>“After dinner.”</p>

<p>“To-day? Where?”</p>

<p>“In the walnut grove.”</p>

<p>“At what hour?”</p>

<p>“About half-past three.”</p>

<p>“Imbecile! It is impossible!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Jacques, with a titter, “just as you
say, of course.”</p>

<p>This reply exasperated Barrau.</p>

<p>“I tell you it is impossible, and I do not know what
should prevent me from punishing you for lying.”</p>

<p>“Lying?” repeated Jacques, with rising indignation.</p>

<p>“Yes, lying; for I met him myself, and thrashed him,
at about four o’clock, at Balance Rock.”</p>

<p>Percier was astounded.</p>

<p>“Surely you are speaking of Bruno,” said Jacques at
length.</p>

<p>“Was it, then, Bruno who embraced Catherine in the
walnut grove?”</p>

<p>Ashamed of his stupidity, Suzanne’s husband remained
silent for a moment, and then essayed to repair
his mistake. But Savin, refusing to listen to his ridiculous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Page 95]</span>
explanations, turned angrily away and took the
nearest path for his home.</p>

<p>“There are beasts that never ought to open their
mouths,” growled Andoche, as soon as Savin was out
of hearing.</p>

<p>“You mean me?” inquired Jacques.</p>

<p>“No—oh, no. I mean Napoleon I., of course.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did I know that everybody was in love
with his wife, eh?”</p>

<p>“There will be a great scene when he reaches home,
and you will be the cause, you simpleton. <i>Mon
Dieu!</i> That man told the truth who said that the wicked
are less to be feared than fools, because they sometimes
keep quiet, while fools never do.”</p>

<p>Barrau took long strides, and he breathed as with
difficulty. If he had encountered Catherine at that moment,
a terrible catastrophe might have been the result.
His mind, travelling faster than his limbs, was occupied
with reflections that may be summarized thus: “What
effrontery! In open daylight to caress a blackguard
like that Bruno. They were right in predicting that I
should repent of my contract. The coquette! But is
it true? Bah! What interest would he have in making
up such a story? But perhaps he did not really see it.
Perhaps—but no! Jacques is not a liar. Oh, miserable
woman! To make herself the laughing-stock of the
whole country. But who knows?”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and then went on: “Like all
deceived husbands, I was unable to believe that such a
misfortune could come to me, that such shame could
enter my home. In all St. Benoit there is not a fireside
where they are not mocking me.”</p>

<p>Barrau’s love and vanity were equally wounded. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Page 96]</span>
anger knew no bounds, and by the time he reached
the cottage he was half mad with doubt and sorrow.</p>

<p>Hearing his step on the walk, Catherine came out
to meet him, her face softened by smiles and her general
manner indicating that she desired a reconciliation.
While awaiting Savin she had arranged a little confession
she now purposed to offer. If on this day Firmin
had kept out of Savin’s path, conjugal harmony would
have been restored, for Catherine was resolved to make
the <i>amende honorable</i>. But fatality willed it otherwise.</p>

<p>As Barrau approached, he saw his wife standing by
the door. Irritated to a state of madness, he fancied
he perceived in her friendly attitude and advances only
deception, and in his brutality as a betrayed husband he
raised the butt of his gun and struck her without a word
of warning or explanation. Never afterward could the
misguided fellow forgive himself or forget that scene.</p>

<p>Catherine stood silent and immovable. Never had
she dreamed of this. Not only had he insulted her,
but the blow had given her pain; but the latter was as
nothing compared to the fury which took possession of
her brain. Springing to her feet, she made one bound
for his throat, and a pitiful struggle ensued. Catherine
was naturally the first to yield, and she cried for help.
Her cries brought Barrau partially to his senses. He
stopped and stepped back, leaving his wife leaning
against the buffet, panting for breath.</p>

<p>A moment’s silence intervened, and then seizing her
arm he exclaimed: “You are lost, do you know it? And
as for that villain Bruno—I will kill him! Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is Bruno, then, that you want to kill? Well,
he is no coward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Page 97]</span></p>

<p>“Shameless woman!”</p>

<p>“Cruel monster!”</p>

<p>After uttering these words Catherine, with the manner
of a maniac, rushed up the staircase and locked
herself in her room, resolved to wait until the morrow
before breaking with the man from whom there was now
nothing to hope.</p>

<p>“He does not dare to come here,” she mentally exclaimed
as she crossed the apartment.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Barrau speedily repented of his infamous
conduct. To assault a woman, be she ever so
culpable, is a dishonorable, shameful proceeding, and to
think that he, a soldier and gentleman, had been guilty
of such a thing. He was mortified and penitent. But
when he thought of Bruno and Firmin his heart seemed
bursting with indignation. He foresaw greater trouble
and despair claimed him as her own. “If I could die,”
he whispered to himself, “all would be settled. But
no. That is a cowardly thought. However, this state
of affairs must end. To-morrow she will probably go
away. If she doesn’t I shall return to my old lodgings
in the barracks.”</p>

<p>The night passed and neither slept. A prey to melancholy
thoughts and schemes of vengeance, each paced
the floor through the long watches of darkness, lonely
and wretched.</p>

<p>At about nine o’clock on the following morning
Catherine descended the stairs and passed the exhausted
Savin, who was asleep in a chair. With nervous
step she left the house and started toward the
village.</p>

<p>At the pond where Rosalie and others were engaged
in washing clothes, tongues were wagging industriously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Page 98]</span>
The latest gossip was in everybody’s mouth. For the
moment Firmin was the subject of conversation. He
had just passed by and they had persuaded him to tell
his grievance.</p>

<p>When Catherine crossed the little bridge under which
the women were at work, all tongues ceased. Andoche
alone saluted her with a sarcastic “Good-morning,”
adding, “and did you pass a pleasant night?”</p>

<p>Catherine hastened on without replying. The village,
the meadows, the forest, the people, all seemed hateful
to her. To leave the country was all that she now desired.
But she wished to be free to go where she liked
and to do as she pleased, to which end she was going to
consult with Monsieur Eugène.</p>

<p>“I have had enough of this wretched life. The
courts shall separate us, and I will go to earn my living
in Paris or elsewhere.”</p>

<p>As she proceeded some peasants bowed to her, but she
did not notice them. Upon arriving at Monsieur Eugène’s
house she knocked, and old Jeannette, the servant,
opened the door.</p>

<p>“Is your master at home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame. Will you come in?”</p>

<p>Monsieur Eugène was occupied for the moment with
a land-owner who was consulting him as to whether he
should sell a piece of property, so the maid ushered
Catherine into a waiting-room where a man was also
waiting. Upon seeing him Catherine stepped backward
toward the door, but the man, greatly excited, rose
to his feet and said: “Your husband, then, has lost his
senses?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur Firmin, I fear so.”</p>

<p>“But that is no reason why he should insult me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Page 99]</span></p>

<p>“Is it on your account that he has been tempted to
kill me?” demanded Madame Barrau.</p>

<p>“Without doubt, since it is on your account that he
has insulted me. He has boasted all over the country
of having thrashed me, of having broken my head.”</p>

<p>“And it is not true?”</p>

<p>“No, it is not true,” he declared with bravado.</p>

<p>No witnesses to his chastisement having been present,
Firmin had decided to tell his own story. If the
gamekeeper had said nothing concerning the encounter
at Balance Rock, Firmin doubtless would have kept
silent. But to have it proclaimed abroad was too much
of a shock to his <i>amour propre</i> to pass over in silence.</p>

<p>Early on this day, therefore, he had come to consult
with Monsieur Eugène as to the best method of summoning
Savin to court. But all along the road he had been
twitted about his encounter with Barrau, and upon his
arrival at the counselor’s house he was fairly boiling
with rage. He had been asked to wait, but he was restless
and disturbed, when the door had opened and Catherine
had walked in. But she was more angered than
Firmin and her words were nettling and impetuous.</p>

<p>“If he has not struck you down,” she said, with the
intention of pushing him to the last extremity, “be sure
he will do it, and that, too, before the world.”</p>

<p>“He does not dare!”</p>

<p>“Bah! Who is to prevent him, eh? Are <i>you</i> the
man to do it?”</p>

<p>“Take care, Madame Catherine Barrau! Don’t excite
me beyond all reason. It wouldn’t take much urging
for me to kill him—your charming husband.”</p>

<p>“Come, now, I defy you! You are too much of a
coward!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Page 100]</span></p>

<p>Though they were speaking in muffled tones, they
were thoroughly aroused and the energy of mad passion
controlled their words.</p>

<p>“If only you could have loved me, fair tigress,”
said Firmin in a whisper, overcome by her imperial
beauty.</p>

<p>“I do not love people who are the laughing-stock of
the village. Everybody is making fun of you. Were
you less a coward Savin would have paid for his insults
from you before this. Bruno would have found a way
to have punished him.”</p>

<p>Bruno! Catherine well knew how to touch Firmin’s
jealousy. For a month she had listened to his advances
half condescendingly, but Bruno’s name always strangely
affected him. Was Bruno his rival? At any rate, her
way of exasperating him was successful.</p>

<p>“The gamekeeper shall die before to-morrow morning!”
said he desperately.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“I swear it! And it will be so much the worse for
you.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for me! How so?” she inquired,
trying to appear unconcerned and succeeding
only in looking terribly in earnest. Without answering
her question Firmin, after a brief hesitation, held out his
hand.</p>

<p>“Is it agreed?” he asked with a significant look.</p>

<p>In reply Catherine raised her hand and the compact
was sealed.</p>

<p>“In order to accomplish my purpose, he must remain
out to-night.”</p>

<p>“He shall do so.”</p>

<p>“When you hear a gunshot——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Page 101]</span></p>

<p>He stopped. It was useless to continue or to explain,
and as his consultation with Monsieur Eugène was now
objectless, he left the house.</p>

<p>Catherine, however, was not yet ready to make her
adieus. Her errand was still to be performed.</p>

		CHAPTER XIII.<br>
		<small>THE CONSULTATION.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Scarcely had the outer door closed upon Firmin when
Monsieur Eugène finished his interview with the land-owner,
and presently Catherine was asked to come into
his office.</p>

<p>A strange man was Monsieur Eugène. He was rich
in many good qualities, but he had one fault, or rather
an unfortunate failing, which had practically destroyed
those gifts of nature which would have made him a
great success had he but devoted himself to one profession
or one art.</p>

<p>Having received a liberal education in other branches,
Eugène Bertier went to Paris to study medicine. For
three years he applied himself to this science with an
unusual enthusiasm. Not a student in the college could
compare with him in diligence or knowledge. He was
held up as an example to the other students, and was
very popular among the foremost surgeons in the institution.
One day a little child, a girl of fourteen, was
brought to the hospital. She was a winsome, intelligent
little thing who had been cruelly burned in a fire while
attempting to save a baby brother. From the first
moment he saw her Eugène gained an affection almost
paternal for the little girl—his No. 17, as he called
her, being his seventeenth patient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Page 103]</span></p>

<p>The principal doctor said to him: “Monsieur Bertier,
I place this little girl in your charge. I believe that
you can cure her.”</p>

<p>Eugène accepted the trust, saying: “Yes, I am sure
of it.”</p>

<p>The little girl had the utmost confidence in her young
physician, and seeing with what tenderness he dressed
her burns, she bore the pain with rare fortitude. The
right side of her body was a mass of sores. With compressed
lips she endured the agony of having the cotton
changed, not a cry escaping her. When the pain was
less intense, when she was comparatively easy, the young
doctor questioned her concerning her family and home
life, winning her confidence by his kind and sympathetic
manner. Alas! little Madelaine’s story was a sad
one. Her father, a well-born, honest, and worthy man,
becoming financially embarrassed, had ended his troubles
by committing suicide. He had left four children
and a nervous, sickly wife to battle with the world. The
mother soon afterward had died, and young Madelaine
had been left to provide for her little brothers and sister—not
for long, however, for in trying to save her
youngest charge, who perished in a fire, she herself had
been terribly burned, and the two other children had
been handed over to charity.</p>

<p>Quite simply she told her story, as though her pain
and suffering were but natural and merited. Monsieur
Eugène was touched. “First,” he mentally concluded,
“let me cure her and then I will see what can be done.”</p>

<p>Every day he brought to her some delicacy: a basket
of fruit, a nosegay, or some bonbons. Never was a
brother more devoted to a sister than was he to the
afflicted child. The treatment to which he resorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Page 104]</span>
seemed certain. It was now only a question of time,
and each day the affection between the two grew
stronger.</p>

<p>“Fortunately I am rich, and when she is strong
enough I will establish her in a little flower-stall wherever
she wishes it to be located.”</p>

<p>Then the hot weather came and Eugène redoubled
his precautions and care. One day, however, he found
a little white spot upon the flesh where the burn had
resisted his treatment.</p>

<p>Calling the chief surgeon, he showed him the spot and
expressed his own fears in a whisper. “That is nothing,”
said the surgeon. “Don’t worry about it.”</p>

<p>He prescribed another application, but on the following
day Madelaine was worse. Then Eugène called in
consultation the most famous practitioners in all Paris,
but in vain.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later the young girl died in his
arms. Science had failed to save her.</p>

<p>The grief-stricken young physician thus depreciated
the art of healing: “For what purpose is science?
What matters it how hard one studies or how deeply
one delves into scientific research if one can do nothing
at a time like this? Science, after all, is only an illusion,
and the scientists are humbugs. I do not wish to
deceive those who come to me in confidence. I will
renounce this so-called science. I will not be a physician.”</p>

<p>His decision was irrevocable. But as he was by
nature fond of work he could not remain idle or aimless,
and accordingly three months later he began the study
of painting. After four years in this pursuit he abandoned
it to study law. Whatever he undertook he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Page 105]</span>
well, and his brilliant attainments won for him the respect
of every one. But he spoiled everything by always and
at every step exacting of himself perfection. The men
with whom he came in contact must be irreproachable.
To see wickedness and immorality on all sides was terrible
to him. The means which men employed to
succeed in life disgusted him. Here and there he saw
that men of brains often fell short of success, while dull
and irresponsible men were on the top wave of prosperity,
and these glimpses of life shocked his too sensitive
nature.</p>

<p>It is a decided mistake not to take humanity for what
it is worth, without stopping to speculate and to moralize.
But poor Eugène could not understand the frailty
of mankind, and so one day at the age of thirty-five, disillusioned,
not knowing what to do, regretting his own
unworthiness, but convinced that a man truly honest
and pure-minded will strive to make his own life unimpeachable
before criticising the foibles of others, he
realized how little real good he had done in the world.
Visions of the fields and hedges of Morvan came to his
mind, and finally he returned to his native town to put
all his knowledge and acquirements at the service of his
unsophisticated neighbors.</p>

<p>Twenty years later he still dwelt at St. Benoit, where a
fellow-citizen could not construct a house, fell a tree,
marry a girl, make a will, buy a meadow or undertake a
lawsuit without consulting Monsieur Eugène. Always
good-natured and generous, he gave himself up unreservedly
to all their interests. He cured their wounds,
settled their disputes, and advised them in their conduct,
and only asked in return a little gratitude.</p>

<p>To say that Monsieur Eugène did not nourish vague<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Page 106]</span>
regrets would hardly be true. But he had acquired, with
years, a certain indifference to what might have been,
which contributed greatly to his tranquillity of mind.</p>

<p>When Catherine entered he asked her to sit down
for a moment while he wrote a few lines. Monsieur
Eugène’s library was an artistic, beautiful room. Rare
volumes filled the shelves and exquisite <i>objets d’art</i> and
unique <i>vertu</i> were scattered about in profusion. All these
things, however, were quite lost upon the ordinary peasant
who came to him for advice. Only a few, like Catherine
and Savin, could appreciate his taste, the rest declaring
that Monsieur Eugène was <i>bizarre</i> and eccentric
in this particular. Catherine was too much excited to
contain herself, and stepping up to his desk she simply
said: “Monsieur Eugène, I want to procure a separation.”</p>

<p>“What! Has Savin been unkind to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and moreover he struck me on the shoulder. I
will not stand such indignities, of course, and besides,
we are both unhappy together, so it will be far better if
we are separated.”</p>

<p>“Was any one present at your quarrel?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That is unfortunate, for witnesses are necessary in
such a case. A tribunal would not be satisfied with
your word alone.”</p>

<p>“Ah! and what if he kills me in the mean time?”</p>

<p>“My dear Catherine, I do not say the law is always
agreeable. I only tell you what the law is.”</p>

<p>“Then it is impossible for me to free myself from
him?”</p>

<p>“No. If Savin confesses that he struck you, that will
suffice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Page 107]</span></p>

<p>“Then he will confess it, for he desires a separation
quite as much as I do.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Have you any money?”</p>

<p>“Why? Do I need much?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“What! must I be subjected to insult, maltreatment,
and abuse because I have no money?”</p>

<p>“Alas!”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> And then the world is astonished because
a man is tempted to kill his wife or a woman
to——”</p>

<p>“Say no more, Catherine. The words may cost you
dear.”</p>

<p>“But how unreasonable!”</p>

<p>“The law provides, however, in cases like yours, that
if one of the parties be really a worthy object of judiciary
assistance, the government will furnish it.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall seek such aid. How can I do so?”</p>

<p>“Wait one minute and tell me, is it true that you permitted
Bruno to embrace you yesterday in the walnut
grove?”</p>

<p>Catherine blushed and lowered her eyes.</p>

<p>“Be frank with me, Catherine. I am your friend.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, it is true; but if you only knew the circumstances——”</p>

<p>“Listen, Catherine. You have been very indiscreet,
and naturally your husband is mad with jealousy and
wounded pride.”</p>

<p>“O Monsieur, do not discuss the question. I understand
all you would say; but do you not think I can
obtain the assistance you speak of?”</p>

<p>“Candidly, no. You cannot.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Page 108]</span></p>

<p>“Because you have been at fault, and inquiries will
be made regarding your character, and Savin’s as
well.”</p>

<p>“What of that?”</p>

<p>“Everybody knows Savin and admires him. The
magistrates will learn about the raspberry <i>fête</i> last summer
and its consequences. Besides, you have been
most imprudent in your attitude toward Firmin and
Bruno.”</p>

<p>“But, Monsieur——”</p>

<p>“My child, even if you had the necessary means to
push a lawsuit, I should still advise you to desist.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because Savin married you under most peculiar
circumstances, and you must not forget his generosity
and magnanimity in shielding you against the world.
Most women would adore such a man, no matter how
jealous he was. Such a man never has any difficulty in
finding friends to defend him.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing more to say, Monsieur. Good-morning,”
said Catherine, as she hastened with an injured
look toward the door.</p>

<p>Understanding her feelings, Monsieur Eugène quietly
rose and opened the door for her. Sad and troubled,
Catherine went away. As she was passing the inn she
heard a loud discussion going on. Andoche’s voice
could be heard above all the others, but Firmin too was
talking loudly, trying to defend himself against their
taunts.</p>

<p>“She is pretty, to be sure, Firmin,” Fadard was saying,
“but you must run a great risk.”</p>

<p>“Can it be that you have been to the war?” asked
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Page 109]</span></p>

<p>“What a gay cavalier you are,” declared a third.</p>

<p>“May you live to grow old,” cried Fadard, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted Firmin, at last, “or you will be
sorry.”</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“Well, you just wait long enough and he will do you
up in the same way, Monsieur; and then we shall see
how much there is to your boasted bravery. You are
as much of a poacher as anybody.”</p>

<p>“Look out—here comes Savin’s wife.”</p>

<p>“Well, she will shut his mouth quick enough.”</p>

<p>Firmin seized a bottle and brandished it over the
head of Nicolas, the last speaker. Andoche interposed,
and Firmin, availing himself of the opportunity to escape,
ran out of the inn and soon overtook Catherine on
the road. She greeted him with an air of hauteur.</p>

<p>“I know what a coward you are,” she said. “I see I
can look to you for nothing.”</p>

<p>“I will kill him to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, you are only boasting.”</p>

<p>“I will kill him, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“And <i>I</i> don’t believe you.”</p>

<p>With a savage gesture Firmin turned and left her.</p>

	<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">
		CHAPTER XIV.<br>
		<small>CRIME.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>In her soul Catherine felt quite positive that Firmin
would not dare perpetrate the act he had voluntarily
promised to do; still she resolved to keep Savin out
that night, if possible. By a grim fatality, however,
Savin went abroad on his own account.</p>

<p>When Catherine reached home she found him still
sound asleep. Overcome by fatigue, he had dropped
into slumber without removing his clothes several hours
before. At about five o’clock in the afternoon he
awoke with a sudden start, ate a bit of luncheon, and
then set to work cleaning his gun, being thus and in
other ways engaged until nearly ten o’clock, when without
a word he shouldered his weapon and started out
of the house.</p>

<p>To Catherine there was something grewsomely suggestive
in the departure of the man whom she might
never see again alive.</p>

<p>Involuntarily she advanced as though to call him
back. But pride, in collusion with baser feelings, conquered
her, and the wretched woman lingered with her
hand on the door-knob until the sound of his retreating
steps had died away and all was still.</p>

<p>Then she sought her bed, but her intention to go to
sleep calmly was frustrated. In a short time she began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Page 111]</span>
to weigh her means of defence in case she were complicated
in the proposed crime.</p>

<p>The night was characterized by a dry, cold atmosphere.
An occasional gust of wind shivered the leaves
of the trees, among which the silver gleams of the high-poised
moon fantastically played. The stillness would
have been continuous but for the shrill interruptions of
watchful owls.</p>

<p>Thoughtfully Savin strode on, taking the road which
led to the Trinquelin, by a descent into a ravine.</p>

<p>Overcome with a sudden remorse, Catherine left her
bed, and opening a window gazed out into the night.
After several minutes of unpleasant silence she heard
stealthy footsteps approaching, and soon a man’s figure
appeared to view. The sight filled Catherine with a
double sense of horror. She opened the window and in
a loud voice cried: “Firmin, go home!”</p>

<p>But the unresponsive figure only hastened on in the
gloom of the oak-trees. Hurrying out of the house,
Catherine was bent on overtaking the person ahead of
her. As she advanced she gave earnest utterance to the
words: “Stop, Firmin! Abandon your object! Pray
come back! I am unwilling——”</p>

<p>But the figure had disappeared.</p>

<p>“It is fate,” murmured the young woman, who was
shaking like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>Eleven o’clock sounded. As the night advanced
Catherine was torn the more by conflicting emotions.
Love and despair grappled her heart. The more she
thought of Savin as lost to her forever, the greater
seemed her love for him. And yet she could not help
but feel that he had humiliated her before the world.</p>

<p>At a little past midnight she heard carriage wheels.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Page 112]</span>
The horses’ hoofs clattered over the frozen road, and
then passing the cottage at the corner of the wood their
echoes grew fainter and fainter until they no longer could
be heard. Was her husband’s wounded or death-cold
form being borne away in that late-hour vehicle?
Catherine asked herself this question with a cold shudder,
as she crouched down beside her chamber window
and waited. Perchance to distract her thoughts she
began to count the branches of the trees in front of the
cottage. But this was a vain and mocking pastime.
Every rustle of the leaves to her alarmed senses seemed
like the report of a gun. Even the creaking of the floor
under her weight as she moved startled her. Once
more she went to bed, but only to toss about in dire
distress.</p>

<p>The terrible situation appalled her; and the more she
considered it, the more atrocious seemed the part she
was playing. Visions of Savin her husband, he who
had protected her against the world, the man to whom
she owed everything—wounded and perhaps dying at
that very moment—haunted her. And yet, he had
humiliated her. Yes; but what a fearful vengeance—that
he should die because of a few vehement words!</p>

<p>Two o’clock. O God! Would the night never
pass? Perhaps, after all, he was safe. “Firmin is
such a coward! Who knows if he would dare carry
out his threat? Why do I torment myself about it?
When Firmin sees Savin, he will not dare lift his little
finger. God be praised! Firmin is a poltroon—<i>that</i> I
know, and why should I fear?”</p>

<p>Half-past two.</p>

<p>“How the hours creep! Oh, what if Firmin should
attack him from behind? Yes, that is what he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Page 113]</span>
do—the coward! He would take him unawares. And
<i>I</i> am the cause! Oh, no, no! It cannot be!”</p>

<p>Catherine hurriedly dressed herself, determined to
seek her husband and end her apprehensive suspense.
As she crossed the threshold the air made her shiver
and she turned back, and while searching for her shawl
she regained a share of her wonted composure.</p>

<p>“After all,” she reflected aloud, “I am foolish. If
Firmin, as is probable, becomes frightened and runs home,
I shall only get deeper into trouble. At this hour all
is settled, one way or the other, but Savin probably is
quite safe and uninjured. Firmin is too much of a
coward to carry out his threat. And why should I show
such an interest, anyway? Why, indeed?”</p>

<p>In a nearly tranquil mood she again seated herself at
the window. But her tranquillity did not last long.
Soon she was assailed by doubts and emotions that
brought fresh tears to her eyes.</p>

<p>“But what if he be dead at this instant? What if he
were so far from here that I could not have heard the
report?”</p>

<p>A revulsive paroxysm of grief and remorse made her
moan piteously.</p>

<p>“Who knows but that he may be dying with no one
near to help him?”</p>

<p>How terrible is remorse! Catherine, during those
moments of suspense, suffered untold anguish, and
when at last she could endure it no longer, she snatched
up her wrap and rushed out into the night. The clock
tinkled four as she closed the door behind her.
Possessed with the one idea of finding her husband,
she hurried on, but just as she entered the wood she
heard a loud reverberating report.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Page 114]</span></p>

<p>“O God! I am too late!” cried the distracted
woman, as she fell on her knees like a sobbing suppliant.
Soon, however, she recovered herself in a measure, but
instead of flying to Savin’s side, her one thought was to
get home as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>“They must find me alone and asleep,” she murmured,
“when they come to break the news.”</p>

<p>In her confusion it did not occur to her that Savin
might be only wounded and that immediate relief
might save him. Nor did she dream that anybody
could have seen her leave the house—only to return
precipitately after the shot was fired, and lock the door,
which all night had remained unlocked, behind her.</p>

<p>Mounting the staircase she entered her bed-room and
prepared for bed. But her every nerve was on the
alert. The ticking of the little clock on the mantelpiece
sounded like a cannon in her ears. What a dreadful
suspense! Would they never come? In a waiting,
listening attitude she seated herself by the window.</p>

<p>“Do I hear footsteps on the walk?” she asked herself.
“No, it is only the beating of my heart.”</p>

<p>A death-like soundlessness prevailed.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a demon is that Firmin! I would kill him
if he stood before me now,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Five o’clock sounded.</p>

<p>“I hear a step on the pebbles. Thank Heaven! somebody
is coming. Good God! how my heart throbs.
But I must feign sleep or I am lost. They are knocking
at the door. Now to play my part. Oh, Holy
Mother, forgive my sin! Remorse—no, it is my conscience—makes
me cowardly.”</p>

<p>Tremblingly she leaned out of the window and
looked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Page 115]</span></p>

<p>“God be praised!” she cried. “It is Savin.”</p>

<p>Mad with joy, and penitent as Magdalen, she sped
down-stairs, drew the bolt, tore open the door, and
seizing Savin’s arm attempted to lead him within.</p>

<p>“At last!” she breathlessly cried. She noticed nothing
strange in his appearance, so delighted was she to
know that he was living. The gamekeeper surveyed his
wife with unsteady eyes. Any other person would have
seen that the poor fellow was wounded. Catherine saw
nothing of the sort. His expression was awful in its
intensity. Convinced that his wife was the cause of his
wounds, he had dragged himself home to avenge himself,
should he retain sufficient strength. With superhuman
effort he had walked the whole distance alone.
Blind to everything but the one thought that Savin had
been spared to her, she attempted to embrace him.</p>

<p>“Miserable hypocrite!” he shouted. And with a
great effort he raised his hand and struck her face.</p>

<p>“So violence and brutality are to be the reward for
my penitence. Very well,” she wildly exclaimed, her
better feelings again overpowered.</p>

<p>Without hesitation she slammed the door in Savin’s
face and turned the key. Losing his balance, Savin
uttered a groan as he fell on the steps with a thud.</p>

<p>Again the young woman mounted the staircase in
anger.</p>

<p>“Why do I ever try to conciliate him?” she said to
herself. “Twice he has repulsed me when I have tried
to bring about amiable relations. But I have finished.
Let him strike me again if he dares.”</p>

<p>Now that she had seen him safe and well, as she supposed,
her anxiety ceased. She reproached herself for
having passed the night in worrying. “What a night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Page 116]</span>
I have passed! And all for nothing! But it is over
now. I shall never be such a fool again.”</p>

<p>By some strange fatality, each time either of them
had made overtures to the other some awkward step on
the part of the latter had prevented a reconciliation.
Reflecting upon this fact, Catherine became the more
incensed. Seated upon the edge of her bed she waited.
At about half-past six she heard approaching footsteps.
Suddenly an awful shriek was given, and then followed
the sound of running feet. Catherine listened with
every nerve on the alert. Soon a voice said: “Firmin
is the man who dealt this blow—the ruffian!”</p>

<p>“What can have happened?” Catherine asked herself,
as she crept to the window and looked out. The
heavens away in the east were violet and rose tinted;
while Aurora, beautiful as a dream, was ascending the
sky.</p>

<p>“He is dead,” said a voice under the window.</p>

<p>“Dead, dead!” repeated Catherine, her eyes dilating
with horror. “Merciful heavens! Not dead?”</p>

<p>She vaguely comprehended that they were speaking
of her husband. A low murmur of voices arose from
the spot where the gamekeeper lay; but the peasants,
superstitiously awed, dared not touch the body, and all
were speaking in suppressed tones. More than one
whispered to his neighbor that Madame Catherine
might be able to name the murderer.</p>

<p>“She is a D’Angerolles, you know,” added another,
significantly.</p>

<p>Every moment some new-comer joined the crowd
which surrounded poor Savin’s body.</p>

<p>“Come, let us go inside,” at last suggested one of
the men. But upon trying the door he found it locked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Page 117]</span>
and knocked loudly. Endeavoring to compose herself,
Catherine hastily arranged her dress, and crossed the
room toward the staircase. In passing before the mirror
that surmounted the mantelpiece she involuntarily
looked in the glass. By the dim gray light a shadow
seemed to rest upon her face.</p>

<p>“My God! what is it?” she cried in terror.</p>

<p>Lighting a candle, she gazed once more into the little
glass. In the glimmering, flickering light she saw upon
her livid cheek the traces of a bloody hand. Savin’s
five fingers, which had been covered with blood from
his wound, when he struck his wife, had left their imprint
on her face. In a moment more she would have
faced the throng with those marks upon her face—by
which her husband had branded her as a criminal.</p>

<p>“Look! Madame Catherine has struck a light. She
must be coming down,” said Mathieu.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better break it to her gently?” suggested
somebody.</p>

<p>“Bah!” replied a woman. “She probably knew all
about it before we did.”</p>

<p>Meantime Catherine washed away the stains as well
as she could, but it seemed to her as though some of
them never could be effaced. Down below all wondered
why she was so long in coming. At length, after
washing her face several times, she descended the stairs.</p>

<p>When she appeared on the threshold, her countenance,
mobile and composed, was scrutinized by all,
and suspiciously by many. On the doorstep, just as he
had fallen, lay poor Savin. Catherine saw him, and a
desolate cry escaped her. Falling on her knees she
drew his head upon her lap, and with a passionate
moan, more of remorse than of despair, she stroked his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Page 118]</span>
cold face. But to the spectators present it seemed but
a bit of clever acting, and they manifested signs of distrust
of her.</p>

<p>“She is playing a <i>rôle</i>,” cried Mathieu, sneeringly, but
he was in error. For as she now looked upon his pale
dead face, so drawn and still, all hatred of her husband
disappeared, and her being was scourged by the thought
that he had met his death because of her.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wild hope filled her heart. Leaning over
her husband’s prostrate form, she pressed her ear
against his breast.</p>

<p>“He still lives!” she cried. “He lives!”</p>

<p>Realizing that her hope was not in vain, her tears
ceased to well up in her swollen eyes.</p>

<p>“Help me,” she commanded, as she tried to lift the
body in her arms. Several in the crowd came forward
to assist her. Her emotion nearly convinced them of
her innocence, and only one among them, Andoche, intuitively
felt that she was guilty, and yet sincere in her
grief.</p>

<p>A mattress was brought from the house and the gamekeeper
was carefully placed upon it.</p>

<p>“You, Lucien,” said Catherine, to a little boy of fifteen
who was standing near, “you must run to Quarré
and bring Monsieur Morris, the doctor, at once.”</p>

<p>When he was removed within, Catherine laved Savin’s
wounds. A single discharge of lead had entered
the chest on the left side a little below the heart. Profuse
bleeding had rendered him insensible, but his heart
was still beating.</p>

<p>“He is not dead! No, no! He breathes!” Catherine
kept repeating. “Listen, George, don’t you hear
him breathe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Page 119]</span></p>

<p>George was a young student of Trinquelin who possessed
no little intelligence.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is living,” he declared. So great was her
joy at this assurance that all now felt fully convinced of
her innocence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Andoche, who alone felt undeceived, left
the others, determined to follow the trail of blood which
indicated the way the wounded man had taken. This
trail led him to a little crossway where all signs ceased.
At the right a tuft of high shoots had two or three
broken branches, and the leaves were scattered. This,
then, had been the scene of the assassination. The
murderer had posted himself behind the accusing shrubbery
and had fired at short range.</p>

<p>Little Lucien returned with the doctor, who at a moment’s
notice had mounted his horse, anxious to answer
so extraordinary a summons. Already the intelligence
had spread with that rapidity so characteristic of bad
news, and from Quarré to Trinquelin the matter was being
discussed.</p>

<p>It was now broad daylight. Just behind the doctor
was observed approaching the Chief of Police and one
of his subordinates. A great commotion now prevailed.
Since the day of the great stampede no such crowd had
collected within a radius of twenty miles. From St. Benoit,
from Trinquelin, Bordichon, and all the neighboring
villages, people had assembled. When Bruno heard the
startling news he entered his home completely prostrated.</p>

<p>“Poor Catherine! Poor little woman!” he cried, in
his grief. He did not doubt that she was the cause of
Savin’s death, and he was utterly wretched in the consciousness
that his love for her neither increased nor
diminished with this discovery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Page 120]</span></p>

<p>From all sides rose one cry. All were unanimous in
their decision: “Firmin is the guilty man.”</p>

<p>When the doctor examined Savin, all looked anxiously
for his verdict. At last it came:</p>

<p>“He is not dead, but there is no hope of saving
him,” he said, soberly.</p>

<p>Catherine gave one heart-rending shriek and threw
herself at the doctor’s feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, save him! Save him, I beseech you!” she cried
in anguish.</p>

<p>“My poor woman, I am powerless. He can live but
a few moments.”</p>

<p>By this time the gendarmes had entered the yard and
were seeking information.</p>

<p>“There are only two men capable of killing Barrau,”
said one red-haired old gossip who felt it her duty to
say something.</p>

<p>“Who are they?”</p>

<p>“Why, Madame Barrau’s lovers, of course.”</p>

<p>“You mean Firmin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Bruno, too.”</p>

<p>“What, young Bruno?”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>At this moment little Sidonie appeared. From the
instant she learned of the crime she had been a prey to
tormenting doubts. Bruno’s words on the day of the
wedding recurred to her mind.</p>

<p>“For her,” he had said, “I would be capable of anything—even
of crime.”</p>

<p>“Of crime,” repeated the lame girl, who, though she
trembled like a leaf, possessed an unshaken love for
Bruno.</p>

<p>She arrived just in time to hear Bruno accused. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Page 121]</span>
burning desire to defend him filled her soul, but another
feeling kept her silent. The moment had not come to
take up his defence. When the accusation became formal,
then would be her time.</p>

<p>The conversation was continued, everybody having a
word to say on the subject.</p>

<p>“Young Bruno,” said Suzanne the bride, “surely he
is too honorable to have dreamed of such a thing. Oh,
no!”</p>

<p>“That is all very well to say,” returned the red-haired
gossip, “but when a man is in love with a coquette, he
sometimes comes pretty near being a villain.”</p>

<p>“You are an old scandal-monger, Madame Calasse,
permit me to say,” broke in Andoche, who had just returned
from his tour of investigation.</p>

<p>“Well, nobody asked your opinion, sir,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“No: I give it unsolicited, and nobody here can prevent
me, either.”</p>

<p>“You scoundrel!”</p>

<p>“You viper!”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” interposed Sidonie, indignantly.
“Don’t dispute in the presence of death. A poor soul
is dying.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, little simpleton! You are a great one to talk.
You will have enough to do if <i>you</i> stand up for Bruno.”</p>

<p>“That is my affair,” replied Sidonie.</p>

<p>Just then Barrau made a movement. In a sort of
convulsion he turned upon his right side.</p>

<p>For a moment the doctor seemed encouraged.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he can name his murderer,” said the Chief
of Police.</p>

<p>“There is no need of that. We all know,” ejaculated
one of the women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Page 122]</span></p>

<p>This statement was greeted with an indecent burst of
laughter from Mademoiselle Faillot, who had come into
the house, as it seemed, solely for the purpose of destroying
by her innuendos the good impression which
Catherine had created.</p>

<p>But the Chief of Police, Monsieur Banastre, was a
loyal, intelligent soldier, and was endowed with a tact
rarely found among men.</p>

<p>“My good woman,” said he to Rosalie, “it is for <i>us</i>
to find out the criminal. You need not play the spy.”</p>

<p>“What!” gasped Léocadia, “you do not care for our
information, then? Why, the police are supposed to
protect——”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” interrupted Banastre, “do not waste
your eloquence upon me. Rosalie wishes to imply that
the presumable assassin is Firmin, the valet.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Léocadia answered.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, as yet we do not know. Everybody says
it, doubtless everybody thinks it, but I should prefer to
hear from the wounded man.”</p>

<p>“From the dead!” solemnly remarked Dr. Morris.</p>

<p>The two men made a military salute, and the people
superstitiously crossed themselves.</p>

<p>Catherine, at the dead man’s side, was weeping bitterly,
and praying with a fervor of which she had felt
incapable eight days before. It was a sad scene, but
Banastre perceived what it was his duty to do.</p>

<p>“Show me the home of Firmin Valeau,” he sternly
ordered.</p>

<p>Little Sidonie came forward and pointed out the
way.</p>

<p>“You see the little red roof there—quite new?” she
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Page 123]</span></p>

<p>“Is that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, little one.—Come, Plagnolles, we must go.”</p>

<p>With regular tread they started down the slope, followed
by many curious peasants. Now that Savin was
dead, why should they remain longer here?</p>

<p>But by the time the chief and his assistant entered the
little enclosure of which Firmin was proprietor, many
had lingered behind to discuss the crime by themselves,
and to express their opinions without fear of reprimand.</p>

		CHAPTER XV.<br>
		<small>WHO IS GUILTY?</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>As soon as Savin’s death was announced, Bruno resolved
at once to keep away from the house. From the
fact that he would be forced, perhaps, to exchange
glances with Catherine, he feared lest he might involuntarily
accuse her of the deed by a facial tremor or an
uncontrollable gesture. But the suspense of waiting for
the news at home was maddening. His imagination
caused him to suffer the greatest anxiety, and the poor
fellow started at every sound, expecting to see Catherine
led away by the gendarmes, followed by a mob of
curiosity-seekers and mockers. A tender pity filled his
heart. What could he do to save her? That was his
one thought as he stood by the window.</p>

<p>He remembered having read in the journals how
under such circumstances the mob sometimes tried to
stone the prisoner. At this idea the blood leaped to his
face and his look became savage. To run madly to her
assistance was the one wish of his heart, but reason
checked him. And then, how could he forsake Mother
Mathurine?</p>

<p>Soon, however, he saw the gendarmes take the road
leading to his cottage. They knew of his love for Madame
Barrau. Perhaps he was suspected and would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Page 125]</span>
arrested. Cold beads of perspiration stood on his
forehead, but he nevertheless experienced a sense of
joy. To sacrifice himself for Catherine was perhaps
the only manner in which he could prove his love—a
joy truly, but a joy half stifled by a revulsion of horror.
Such infamy was unworthy of him.</p>

<p>At this moment old Jeannille Marselon, his neighbor,
appeared solemnly upon the doorstep. With closed lips,
crossed hands, and stern eyes she stood watching the
agents of justice as they approached. Then she fixed
her melancholy eyes on Bruno. Nothing was more
embarrassing than a penetrating glance from the eye
of old Jeannille. Bruno felt his lids contract a little
under the intense look she gave him, and he could well
understand how he would be trembling now had he
been guilty of the crime. She lingered for a moment,
and then with a steady gait started to join the little procession,
which had stopped in front of Firmin’s cottage.</p>

<p>Upon discovering that suspicion had fallen upon the
valet a strange feeling of disappointment took possession
of Bruno. In a burst of jealousy he reproached
himself for not having attracted the suspicion of which
Firmin was the object.</p>

<p>“He dared to do it, and yet he does not love her as
I do. I would die for her,” he inwardly said. A consuming,
all-absorbing passion, indeed, must have ruled
him, that his mind should entertain such reflections. But
how little reason was there for jealousy!</p>

<p>The gendarmes did not find Firmin at his house, but
they were not surprised. A murderer who, after the
deed was done, would quietly remain in his house to be
arrested, would be a simpleton. Nevertheless, the crowd
was disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Page 126]</span></p>

<p>Banastre was about to send Plagnolles to Quarré to
telegraph to Avallon, when a little band of men halted
in front of the house. Four stalwart fellows were carrying
upon a stretcher the body of a man. A cry of
surprise was uttered by more than one spectator, for
the wounded man was none other than Firmin himself.
And in what a state!</p>

<p>His muscles were drawn up in pain, and his face was
the picture of defiant suffering. A clamor of voices
arose.</p>

<p>“It is he!” cried the bystanders.</p>

<p>Banastre and Plagnolles at once established order,
and Firmin was placed in the lower hall of his house.</p>

<p>What could have happened? How had Firmin been
found, and how had he been wounded? All sorts of
guesses were made by the curious crowd, and some most
unreasonable ideas were suggested. Rosalie, as usual,
had her say.</p>

<p>“Of course, Barrau defended himself, and Firmin
must have received a blow in the legs or stomach,” she
observed. Upon the same theme others expatiated.</p>

<p>“Or else,” put in Mathieu, “Firmin was ashamed
of his cowardice day before yesterday, and, as it was
moonlight, he proposed to fight it out, as Savin
wished.”</p>

<p>“That must be it,” said Nicolas. “Savin was killed
and Firmin is wounded.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but that is not half so interesting,” protested
the heartless Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Cruel frog,” exclaimed Andoche, doubtless thinking
that a more insulting epithet than that of an aquatic animal
could not be conceived—he himself being so averse
to water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Page 127]</span></p>

<p>“But no,” said a young fellow of sixteen, “Felicien
Collas says he has not been shot.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter, then?”</p>

<p>“His leg is broken.”</p>

<p>“How did that happen?” inquired Mathieu, vexed
that he had not guessed aright.</p>

<p>“How? How? Go and ask Cremailly of Trinquelin.”</p>

<p>Cremailly was the proprietor of a mill, and just now he
held the attention of the listeners. Under the calm but
piercing gaze of Jeannille Marselon he related how Firmin
had broken his leg under conditions and at a moment
when he could not be accused of murder.</p>

<p>“Well, tell us all you know about it,” urged Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Last evening at a quarter to eleven I opened the
sluice for the night, and was going to bed, when I heard
a noise at the door.”</p>

<p>“’Twas Firmin, eh?” interrupted Mathieu.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment. Don’t be in such a rush. At first
I felt too frightened to go to see who it was, but——”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” cried Andoche, rudely interrupting
him. “Well, go on.”</p>

<p>“Well, soon I heard my name called.”</p>

<p>“That reassured you.”</p>

<p>“A little, but not much. It was my wife Charlotte——”</p>

<p>“Ah! We all know she isn’t afraid of any man.”</p>

<p>“No, not she. She said, ‘Go and see who it is, goose,
or I will get up and go myself.’”</p>

<p>“Then you decided to open the door, of course.”</p>

<p>“Not quite yet; but Charlotte was just about getting
up, so——”</p>

<p>“You are a brave and noble fellow, Cremailly. Accept
my compliments,” again interrupted Andoche.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Page 128]</span></p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you on the day of my wedding.”</p>

<p>“But you are married now.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, stupid, what did your wife do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she got to the door first and found Firmin
lying on the ground with a broken leg.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. Charlotte asked him how he came
there. You know the mountain, in that locality, slopes
to the river. Well, he pretends he tumbled down from
above.”</p>

<p>“That is a curious explanation.”</p>

<p>“But I have an idea,” continued Cremailly, in suppressed
tones, “that the scamp was surprised by some
luckless husband—you know he is a wheedler—and was
obliged to save himself by jumping out of some window.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but whose window?”</p>

<p>“That I do not know. But as he was found by our
door, it could not have been far from us.”</p>

<p>“Charlotte could guess better, perhaps, than you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, women are so quick.”</p>

<p>“Did he have a gun?”</p>

<p>“Firmin? Yes, it laid at his side.”</p>

<p>“Was it loaded, do you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, two cartridges.”</p>

<p>“Well, then it could not have been Firmin who killed
the gamekeeper,” said Andoche.</p>

<p>At the same moment Monsieur Banastre, after interrogating
the wounded man, the bearers of the stretcher
and Madame Cremailly, came to the same conclusion.
Some seven or eight inhabitants of Trinquelin who had
just arrived gave the same evidence as the mill owner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Page 129]</span>
If the valet’s limb was fractured at eleven o’clock in
the evening, he certainly could not have fired the bullet
which killed Barrau at four o’clock on the succeeding
morning.</p>

<p>Being summoned, Dr. Morris declared and demonstrated,
without any hesitation, that the accident must
have taken place on the previous evening. And so
Firmin was declared innocent, absolutely innocent, and
was no longer of special interest to the crowd.</p>

<p>Thus evidently thought Jeannille Marselon, for no
sooner had the doctor spoken than she left, without
having opened her mouth. Curiosity led her to Barrau’s
house, where the attention of the gendarmes would
now probably be directed. The crowd there was still
great, for nearly every moment some new-comer appeared,
and although a large number had followed the
gendarmes to Firmin’s house, yet there was no lack of
people about poor Catherine’s. Jeannille Marselon, with
that tranquil and patient manner of people who act without
speaking, glided quietly into the room and took her
place in the front rank of spectators. Apparently it
was of interest to her to see; for when she approached
the body she arranged her dress, adjusted her cap, and
took up her position with her penetrating gaze fixed
upon Savin’s face. Then she studied Catherine’s countenance,
which was troubled and remorseful.</p>

<p>At first, Catherine did not notice Jeannille, but in a
few minutes she raised her eyes and perceived the
stern, silent old woman watching her. A vague uneasiness
seized her. While the woman scanned her
countenance, Catherine dropped her eyes. Again something
constrained her to look up. The same steady
gaze met her eyes. It was insufferable. She rose, advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Page 130]</span>
a few steps, and then turned her back upon the
woman, but she still felt that awful look penetrating
her inward self. She could endure it no longer. A
vivid red mounted to her forehead, and she in turn
gazed into Jeannille’s eyes defiantly. But only for an
instant. She put her hand to her cheek. The remembrance
of the five bloody fingers made her start aghast.
Could it be that the tell-tale marks were still upon her
face? Terror chilled the blood in her veins. The
flesh seemed to burn in her cheek. It must be—the
marks remained visible. That hand! that dreadful
hand! Oh, how could she escape it? She covered her
face with her hand. The illusion grew so strong she
fancied she felt the warm blood oozing through her fingers.
A desolate cry escaped her lips. “I am lost,”
she inwardly cried. “I am lost, and those people are
torturing me! That hand! that hand!”</p>

<p>She examined the faces surrounding her. No; all
looked kindly and sympathetic. Jeannille alone remained
unfathomable—her terrible eyes fixed upon
Catherine’s features. Unable to bear it, Catherine ascended
the stairs and rushed to the mirror. Nothing!
The skin was fair as ever. Not a trace of blood was
there.</p>

<p>Descending she again kneeled by her husband’s body,
but her own was shaken by convulsions. She concealed
her cheek with her hand, as though afraid the blood-stains
would again become visible. Soon the gendarmes reappeared,
this time accompanied by the justice of the
peace, Monsieur Bérard.</p>

<p>Firmin had triumphantly established his innocence,
and Banastre had said to him, a trifle naïvely: “Ah,
well, you can boast of having had a rare escape by so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Page 131]</span>
opportunely breaking your leg; otherwise you would
now be on the way to Auxerre prison. Everybody was
of one mind in accusing you.”</p>

<p>“If Firmin is not guilty,” said the justice of the
peace, addressing Banastre, as they were proceeding to
Savin’s house, “who is? That is the question.”</p>

<p>The Chief of Police only replied by a shrug of the
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Have you received no hints which might put you
on the track?”</p>

<p>Léocadia Faillot, at that moment, passed by with
Rosalie. Monsieur Bérard’s question impressed her.</p>

<p>“For my part,” she said to her companion, in a voice
sufficiently loud for Banastre and Bérard to hear, “I
believe that if Firmin did not kill the gamekeeper, it
was not because he did not want to do it.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Well, he probably set out for that purpose.”</p>

<p>“Take care, Mam’selle Léocadia, somebody might
hear you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should like to know what he was doing behind
the rocks of Trinquelin at eleven o’clock at night.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, yes!”</p>

<p>“He had a gun, and <i>I</i> believe he was lying in wait
for the gamekeeper when his leg gave out. I tell you
that was it.”</p>

<p>“All the same, it has been proven that it could not
have been Firmin.”</p>

<p>“Very true. But do you suppose that Firmin, who
allowed himself to be boxed on the ears once before by
Savin, like the coward that he is, would have had the
courage to deal this blow unless somebody had goaded
him on?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Page 132]</span></p>

<p>Rosalie lowered her voice considerably: “Do you
mean Catherine?”</p>

<p>“To be sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did think so.”</p>

<p>“You know she is a D’Angerolles. They say that
murder was in the family.”</p>

<p>“Born in the blood, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i> yes.”</p>

<p>“Do the papers say so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the books, too. I have read them myself.”</p>

<p>“Holy Virgin!”</p>

<p>Rosalie was overpowered by this idea, and Monsieur
Bérard, though rather disgusted by Léocadia’s manner,
nevertheless made a note of it.</p>

<p>“That is no proof, however, that she is guilty.”</p>

<p>“I do not say that she actually fired the bullet.”</p>

<p>“What do you say?” demanded the justice, peremptorily.</p>

<p>“I—nothing at all, sir,” responded Léocadia, hurriedly
and in surprise.</p>

<p>After they reached Barrau’s house Monsieur Bérard
began to gaze attentively at the old woman’s face, that
is to say, the face of Léocadia Faillot, who with Rosalie
had followed the two officials back to the little cottage
at the corner of the wood.</p>

<p>Léocadia Faillot was fifty-eight years old, but she
might easily have been taken to be ten years older; for
she belonged to that category of old maids who look as
though they never had been young and pretty. Wicked
little eyes, a short flat face covered with furrows and
wrinkles, a head almost bald, and a long skinny neck
were her principal features; while with these her character
was in perfect accord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Page 133]</span></p>

<p>The justice regarded her for some time in silence, and
then asked Banastre who she was.</p>

<p>“Her name is Mademoiselle Faillot.”</p>

<p>“Ah, and what sort of a person is she?”</p>

<p>“I do not know exactly, but there are plenty who do.
I would recommend you, among others, to go to a certain
Andoche Grignon, a blacksmith by trade. He is
generally drunk; but when he is sober, as he is to-day,
he is not wanting in good sense.”</p>

<p>“You must point him out.”</p>

<p>While these words were being exchanged Léocadia
was circulating the report that most likely Catherine
would be arrested before long.</p>

<p>“Any one must be blind,” said she, “not to see that
she is guilty. The other person who committed the
deed was but the instrument. She planned it, you may
be sure.”</p>

<p>Everybody knew that Léocadia hated the Barraus.
Especially against Savin she had cherished an irrepressible
hatred. Now he was dead, and the sum total of
her hatred fell upon Catherine. If Léocadia was possessed
of a peculiar physiognomy, her moral qualities
were equally peculiar. By all she was considered an
evil genius. Unmarried and unloved, she had for more
than a quarter of a century stirred up strife among the
villagers whenever occasion permitted. It seemed as
though she were the very incarnation of discord. Turning
hot or cold according to will, she influenced the
mayor against the curate, the curate against the community,
the community against the bishopric. Malicious,
hypocritical, and treacherous, she was one day at peace
and the next day at war with her neighbors. Evilly disposed
and disagreeable, she yet practised a sort of ostensible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Page 134]</span>
good will, which led people to say: “Well, perhaps
she is like the devil—not so black as she’s painted.”</p>

<p>In the present case, as in all others, she put herself
to the front because it was her nature to embroil her
acquaintances in rows. Whenever any such occasion as
this one presented itself, she had always pushed herself
into prominence. She was always ready to advise
strange things, and many feared her as a dangerous
woman. By her insinuations she hoped to secure Catherine’s
arrest.</p>

<p>The examining magistrate would demand her presence
at Auxerre, and, in her own mind, she would be regarded
as of great importance. Moreover, Catherine d’Angerolles
was too handsome to come out of this affair unscathed.
According to Léocadia, it would require a
volume to relate Catherine’s coquetries; and as she was
the daughter of an assassin, and had lived unhappily
with her husband immediately prior to his death, was it
not reasonable to implicate her? And, in any event,
Catherine should suffer if Léocadia could bring it about.
And so in less than an hour Mademoiselle Faillot had
persuaded nearly every one into her way of thinking; and
Catherine, the daughter of D’Angerolles, and not universally
popular, was but feebly defended.</p>

<p>“If Firmin had been unable to prove an alibi, she
most likely would have been arrested with him,” declared
Léocadia.</p>

<p>“But,” returned Father Collas, with a sensible exhibition
of incredulity, “Monsieur Barrau having been a
gamekeeper, it is more than possible that a poacher——”</p>

<p>“A poacher?” interrupted Léocadia. “Who? Do
you know any one in this community capable of such
a misdemeanor? Pray enlighten us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Page 135]</span></p>

<p>This outburst of taunting opposition prompted Father
Collas to beat a hasty retreat, and no one seemed equal
to the task of answering it.</p>

<p>All sorts of reports concerning Catherine were voiced
abroad, and alas! how few were her defenders. Like
a flock of sheep the majority followed their leader, and
accordingly, when Monsieur Bérard questioned some of
them, they echoed Léocadia’s opinions.</p>

<p>One man, however, had the courage of his own convictions,
and that man was Andoche Grignon, the blacksmith.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Bérard, I cannot say anything about it,”
said he.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I do not know any more than the rest.”</p>

<p>“Still you know that Madame Barrau has been a coquette;
that she has flirted a good deal.”</p>

<p>“That is to say, she has been fond of amusing herself,
yes. But I have known a great many women given to
coquetry, and yet who would go no further.”</p>

<p>“So you believe the woman is innocent?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I do not say so, but simply that I believe
nothing.”</p>

<p>“You have no opinion to give, then. Well, you must
admit that she lived at enmity with her husband for five
months.”</p>

<p>“That is no proof. Here I have lived for seven
years unhappily with my wife—Madame Grignon. She
is no angel either. But she never killed me.”</p>

<p>“Well, one thing is certain: Savin Barrau has been
murdered.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and this morning, had you asked my opinion,
I should not have hesitated to accuse Firmin. And you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Page 136]</span>
see I would have been wrong. At all events, Madame
Barrau did not pull the trigger.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you.”</p>

<p>“But who did?” pursued Andoche, meditatively.</p>

<p>“Do you know Léocadia Faillot, by the way?”</p>

<p>“The universal legatee? Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Why do you call her that?”</p>

<p>“It is a title I have given her, because she inherits
something from everybody.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of her?”</p>

<p>“Between ourselves, she is a meddlesome old woman.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“When a good man or woman in the village is about
to die, Mademoiselle Faillot always appears upon the
scene, and makes herself so useful that the poor dying
one offers her some token of appreciation, which she
accepts, and the moment all is over her tongue begins
to wag as usual, maligning the dead as well as the
living.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bérard smiled.</p>

<p>“So I call her the universal legatee. For the last
twenty-five years she has performed ministrations for
the dying. In this way she has earned her living, and
to-day, were it not for Fadard, she would be a rich
woman.”</p>

<p>“Fadard? Who is he?”</p>

<p>“You must know him. The young man who looks
like an old man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know him. Is he here?”</p>

<p>“No, I have not seen him to-day.”</p>

<p>“Is he a relative of Mademoiselle Faillot?”</p>

<p>“Her cousin, so she says,” replied Andoche, with a
funny little gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Page 137]</span></p>

<p>“How old is he, do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“That is a question which the Lord only knows how
to answer.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Faillot just now vehemently accused
Catherine Barrau.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she would accuse her own father, were he living,
rather than keep silent. You will see that in less than
forty-eight hours she will have the whole town in an
uproar.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“She will try to establish two warring factions. That
is her plan of attack, and she never fails to accomplish
her purpose. I tell you she is a venomous creature.”</p>

<p>Andoche was right. Already in the Barraus’ yard
two parties had been formed. One accused Catherine,
and the other, composed of less adherents, proclaimed
her innocence. Among those who were ready to defend
Catherine were brave little Sidonie, Suzanne the young
bride, and her stupid liege, Monsieur Eugène, who gave
no little weight to the cause, and some peasants of less
importance.</p>

<p>Discussions were heard on every hand.</p>

<p>The justice of the peace did not dare to take sides,
but it was evident from the first that the daughter of
D’Angerolles would be arrested, and compelled, if
possible, to reveal the name of her accomplice.</p>

<p>So matters stood, when all at once an incident
occurred which changed the whole aspect of affairs.</p>

		CHAPTER XVI.<br>
		<small>THE ACCUSED.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Since morning Bruno had remained at home, learning
the news as best he could from different sources,
but not daring to go near Catherine for fear of losing
his self-possession.</p>

<p>In his heart he felt that Catherine was implicated.
The proposition she had made him in the walnut
grove he was certain Firmin, a little later, had
accepted. He did not know that the valet was
wounded, but thus far free from the charge. At
length, a young man from Quarré told him the truth.</p>

<p>“If it is not Firmin, then who is it?” thought he,
with the rest. Presently the most harrowing news
began to come to him from different persons. Suspicion
had now fallen upon Catherine, and the accusations
were multiplying against her. Finally, old
Mathieu, in passing Mother Mathurine’s cottage,
shouted out: “It’s a pretty sure thing now against
Catherine. They will guillotine her fast enough.”</p>

<p>Bruno shuddered.</p>

<p>The investigation, then, had so far advanced that the
method of punishment was under discussion. Never
until this day had the poor fellow measured the greatness
of his passion. An overmastering fear came upon
him. He could scarcely stand on account of weakness.
The blood rushed madly to his head. Catherine—Catherine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Page 139]</span>
accused of murder! The idea that perhaps
she was culpable was a torture to him. He ran into
his own chamber to prevent Mother Mathurine from
observing his condition of mind. Despairing and excited,
he threw himself upon the bed and cried aloud.
He was nearly crazed with grief.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” he wailed. “How can I save
her? While I am living she must not go to prison.”</p>

<p>Yes, but how could he prevent it? Could he fight
against the world? Why not carry her into the dense
forest surrounding the town, and there conceal her?
But no, that was not practical. Intuition made him
aware that there was no time to be lost. But what
could he do? His mental anguish was lacerating.
Suddenly a noise arrested his ear.</p>

<p>“They cannot enter now,” he exclaimed, springing
to the door. But it was only a cowherd—that was all.
Words would fail to describe the suffering of the
motionless Bruno.</p>

<p>“Time passes and I must not be idle,” he remarked,
as a thought flashed through his brain. In a dream, as
it were, the little blond head of Sidonie passed before
his eyes, and in a moment he seemed to hear her voice
saying: “But they will take you for an assassin, an
accomplice!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the Barrau cottage the proceedings
revealed Catherine’s peculiar attitude in regard to the
affair. The justice of the peace had found it necessary
to interrogate her. With fixed eyes and half-open
mouth, she sat as though engrossed in one abstraction.
Frequently she raised her hand to her face, as though
to brush away a stain. The remembrance of that bloody
hand was like an avenging fury. Besides, the presence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Page 140]</span>
of Jeannille Marselon, whose look was mesmeric in its
influence, increased her nervousness.</p>

<p>Léocadia Faillot was gossiping as usual.</p>

<p>“She is feigning insanity,” said Léocadia. “See her
face.”</p>

<p>There are people who take pleasure in giving pain.
Mademoiselle Faillot belonged to that genus. She
derived pleasure in witnessing Catherine’s misery.</p>

<p>To the questions propounded by the justice, Catherine
answered: “I do not know,” or “Oh, if he were
<i>living</i>! He is my only judge, my husband!”</p>

<p>“Fine words, indeed!” exclaimed Léocadia, derisively.</p>

<p>“Do you confess that you were implicated in your
husband’s death?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Do you deny it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! I knew she would pretend she had lost her
head.”</p>

<p>So malicious did Léocadia look as she made this
remark that Sidonie indignantly reproved her. The
little cripple had no reason either for loving or defending
Catherine, but she was too fair-minded not to take
her part when she saw others siding against her with
Léocadia.</p>

<p>“You are a wicked woman, Mam’selle Léocadia, a very
wicked woman!”</p>

<p>“Well, I am not an invalid or a cripple.”</p>

<p>“Who knows?” rejoined Sidonie.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Faillot shrugged her shoulders, but
continued her abuse. Meanwhile the crowd began to
threaten Catherine with death. Her only answer was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Page 141]</span>
smile, and that was irritating in the extreme. At length,
the justice decided to arrest her. Just then a young
fellow, half drunk, volunteered his opinion in these
words: “It was your Bruno Volane who dealt the blow
for you, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Bruno Volane,” said the magistrate. “Who is
he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, another one of her lovers.”</p>

<p>“Poor fellow,” groaned Catherine.</p>

<p>The justice made inquiries. The crowd, led by Léocadia,
demanded that some one should be selected
as the culprit. Bruno, for that purpose, seemed as
good as any one to them.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bérard heard many accusations, and then,
after consulting with Banastre, determined to go to
Mother Mathurine’s cottage. A crowd of people followed,
and upon reaching the house they found Bruno
in his room, looking the image of woe.</p>

<p>“He was hiding,” sneered some one.</p>

<p>They conveyed him to the gamekeeper’s house.</p>

<p>“You are accused,” said the justice, “of having
killed Savin Barrau.”</p>

<p>At these words a sigh of relief burst from Bruno’s
lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur, I killed him.”</p>

<p>The moment’s ensuing silence was broken by two
voices—Catherine’s and Sidonie’s.</p>

<p>“It is not true! It is not true!”</p>

<p>But it was the little lame girl who continued: “Do
not listen, Monsieur, do not listen! He is not capable
of it, I assure you. The boy is mad. I will tell you
why he accuses himself.”</p>

<p>Sidonie spoke with a nervous volubility. Her timidity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Page 142]</span>
had fled; her love alone remained invincible. Bruno,
however, maddened by her interference, persisted that
he was guilty.</p>

<p>“I tell you I <i>am</i> guilty. Be quiet, Sidonie. Why
do you defend me? What do you know about it?”</p>

<p>The justice gazed intently at Bruno. Jeannille Marselon
also closely scrutinized him, and for a moment
appeared surprised. The crowd, for a brief interval
stupefied, soon recovered itself, and tongues began wagging
faster than ever.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” exclaimed Léocadia and
Rosalie.</p>

<p>“I have suspected Bruno all along,” said another.</p>

<p>Banastre did not for an instant turn his eyes away
from Bruno’s face. He was puzzled. It scarcely
seemed possible that one with such a frank and guileless
countenance could commit such a heinous crime.</p>

<p>“It must have been one of the two—Firmin or
Bruno,” continued Léocadia.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, be quiet!” cried Sidonie.</p>

<p>“Why should I?” returned Mademoiselle Faillot.
“It is you who ought to go and hide yourself. Perhaps
you dare say you love him, eh? He’s a fine lover.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do love him. God bless him!” exclaimed
Sidonie, with a look of utter devotion.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you. Unfortunately, however, it is
Catherine Barrau that <i>he</i> loves, and he has done this
deed to please <i>her</i>.”</p>

<p>“That is a falsehood, you slanderer!”</p>

<p>“You shall pay for this,” snarled Léocadia.</p>

<p>“We shall see,” retorted the lame girl.</p>

<p>“Silence!” shouted Monsieur Bérard, authoritatively.
“I cannot permit such wrangling. Keep still, every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Page 143]</span>
of you, and remember that to accuse a man of murder
may cost you dear.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never saw such a man as that justice,”
growled Léocadia.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bérard overheard these words.</p>

<p>“Bring that woman here,” he said to Banastre.</p>

<p>Protesting and crying, she was brought forward.
Leading her by the arm, Banastre placed her before the
justice.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Léocadia Faillot.”</p>

<p>“Your age? No lying!”</p>

<p>“Fifty-eight.”</p>

<p>“Married or single?”</p>

<p>“Single.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you adhere to the opinion you expressed
this morning, you formally accuse this young man of
assassination.”</p>

<p>“But, Monsieur, I am my own accuser,” declared
Bruno.</p>

<p>“Pray, do not say that,” cried Sidonie, touching his
arm.</p>

<p>“That is to say, I suppose him to be guilty, since he
alone had any interest in killing the keeper,” averred
Léocadia, in answer to the remark made by the justice.</p>

<p>“So that is your opinion?”</p>

<p>“However,” continued Léocadia, “it is very strange
that you refuse to believe his word when he confesses
the deed. Everybody knows that day before yesterday
Bruno and Madame Barrau were seen together in the
walnut grove. Savin said he would teach Bruno a lesson.
There is not a man in the village who does not
know of Bruno’s love for Catherine Barrau. But if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Page 144]</span>
were judge or gendarme it would not be long before I
had them both on the way to Avallon prison.”</p>

<p>“Do you pretend to dictate to me?”</p>

<p>“No, Monsieur, but——”</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>Monsieur Bérard turned to Andoche: “Is this true?”</p>

<p>“In the main, yes.”</p>

<p>Sidonie, pale and trembling, at length approached
Bruno.</p>

<p>“Why do you say such things, foolish boy? Don’t
you see that will not save her?”</p>

<p>Then going to Catherine the lame girl said: “Come,
Madame, you as well as I have protested that what
Bruno declares is not true. But perhaps you know the
murderer. Then speak his name. Oh, tell us, I implore
you! Bruno did not do this foul deed. Oh, no!
He has spent his life in saving others.”</p>

<p>Many who heard Sidonie’s earnest words agreed with
her. Catherine, in turn, made the inquiry: “Was it
you, Bruno? No.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Madame, it was I.”</p>

<p>“Do you swear it?”</p>

<p>“I swear it.”</p>

<p>Revolving the past in her mind, Catherine recalled
Savin’s blow. The criminal must be somebody whom
Savin thought was sent by his wife, or he would not
have struck at her. And, therefore, Bruno, who had
taken to flight at her proposition, perhaps had reconsidered
it and resolved to carry it out.</p>

<p>“I am a wretched woman,” she said, with a crestfallen
look. Presently she once more withdrew to examine
her cheek. It was burning, and she imagined that the
impression of Savin’s fingers was still there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Page 145]</span></p>

<p>The justice and Banastre continued in consultation.
They were at a loss as to their duty. In the face of
Bruno’s confession, the other evidence seemed to put
upon it a reasonable doubt, but finally they decided to
arrest Bruno. In vain did he protest that he alone was
the criminal; that Catherine was innocent.</p>

<p>“Very well. That the magistrate must decide,” asseverated
the Chief of Police.</p>

<p>For the time being the prisoners were locked up in
two rooms in the house. A guard was placed over
them, and then the justice went home with Monsieur
Eugène. The people likewise sought their homes.</p>

<p>It was now eleven o’clock in the morning.</p>

		CHAPTER XVII.<br>
		<small>IN THE WOODS.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Sidonie, the picture of sorrow, was leaning against
the trunk of a giant oak crying as though her heart
would break. In her merry moods she was never at a
loss for friends, but in her sorrow she wept alone.</p>

<p>Her life seemed ended. She felt crushed and soul
wounded. However, when Mademoiselle Faillot approached
her, and addressed her in mocking terms,
Sidonie staunchly defended herself.</p>

<p>“Don’t provoke me! Don’t provoke me, I say.”</p>

<p>“What! you threaten?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Only go, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Insolent hussy!” cried the enraged Léocadia.</p>

<p>“Take care!” replied Sidonie. “But for you no
one would have believed Bruno. You shall pay for it.
The occasion for revenge always comes. And I will
find a way to get mine if I have to wait until the day
of your death.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Faillot did not like to have her death
mentioned in such a manner.</p>

<p>“Come, come, don’t talk so,” she said, meekly. Then,
followed by a number of her satellites, she walked away.</p>

<p>Jeannille Marselon, to whom none paid any attention,
had planted herself in front of the gamekeeper’s house
and was watching the windows of the rooms in which
Bruno and Catherine were imprisoned. There she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Page 147]</span>
stood as though turned to stone. As Léocadia, however,
approached the house, Jeannille quietly directed
her steps toward Sidonie. Touching the lame girl
softly on the shoulder, she whispered: “<i>L’Ours!</i>”</p>

<p>Sidonie uttered a hopeful, joyful cry. Taking Jeannille’s
hand she raised it to her lips, saying: “I thank
you!”</p>

<p>Then she rose with a radiant face. In every instance
but one, where death or danger had threatened
Bruno, Jean Manant—L’Ours as he was called—had
come to his rescue.</p>

<p>“Why did I not think of him before, Aunt Jeannille?
Do you know where he is?”</p>

<p>“At Vaumarin.”</p>

<p>“Not so far but that I shall find him.”</p>

<p>The weather had changed. Immense clouds were
chasing each other across the heavens. A storm was
imminent. But Sidonie knew no fear. Covered with
her mantle, a narrow cap on her head, and sabots on
her feet, the brave girl fared forth and soon disappeared
among the forest trees. Jeannille Marselon
watched her little red skirt until she was lost to
view.</p>

<p>“Vaumarin,” she softly murmured. The place was
seven good miles away, and the roads were bad. Up
hill and down dale for seven miles the little maid must
go and come back again, over the mountainous roads.
What love, what devotion impelled her! It was to save
the man she adored. If it were in his power Jean
Manant would save Bruno. Of that she was convinced.
Never before had she attempted such an undertaking. It
was not the journey to Vaumarin she dreaded, but the
return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Page 148]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” she murmured to herself, “I will stay there
awhile, and Jean can come on at once.”</p>

<p>And so the lame girl hobbled on. At about one
o’clock she reached a darker and more dismal part of
the wood. It began to snow.</p>

<p>“Better this than rain,” she thought. At first merry
little flakes danced before her eyes, tumbling pell-mell
from above and fluttering joyously about in her path.
For a while the snow did not impede her course. But
when great flakes began to descend, covering her from
head to foot, powdering her fluffy hair, entering her
mouth and filling her eyes—it was more difficult to
proceed.</p>

<p>A melancholy sort of darkness settled around her.
She could not see a dozen steps before her. The reader
must have been in the depths of a great forest, alone and
unprotected, to understand the lame girl’s sensations.
The steady, silent downfall of snow alarmed her. She
imagined all kinds of terrible things. It seemed as
though the snow were preparing a shroud for her. She
was now suffering intensely with the cold. Time and
again she stumbled against the trunk of a tree and for
a moment or more was unable to proceed. But she
bravely started on again, always with Bruno’s fate in
her mind.</p>

<p>She stopped to remove her sabots, thinking she might
go faster. But fear possessed her and she fancied some
one was lying in wait to strike her. “Who then
would save Bruno?” was her boding question. Terror
increased her pace. She looked to the right and to the
left as though expecting to see somebody dart out from
the darkness and seize her. The snow, the difficulty in
advancing, the cold which was intense, and the dampness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Page 149]</span>
which penetrated her clothing, all conduced to render
her situation anything but comfortable. And then
to be alone in the awful stillness! Rain falling upon dry
dead leaves makes a gentle swish, alike soothing and
grateful; the wind, with its soughing monotone, is companionable;
but the snow, with its mysterious white
stillness, suggests a phantom—silent, lone, and solitary.</p>

<p>Shivering and shuddering little Sidonie sped on
through the forest. Ere long she became aware that
she was approaching Vaumarin. What mattered it to
her that her garments were drenched, her feet sore and
bleeding, and her hands almost frozen? She was nearly
there. It was for Bruno’s sake that she had ventured
forth.</p>

<p>While advancing toward one of the cottages she met
a peasant with a load of hay.</p>

<p>“Where is L’Ours?” she asked, in a voice which
startled even herself.</p>

<p>“Ah, it is you, little one! You come from St. Benoit
at this hour. Well, well!”</p>

<p>“Where is Jean Manant?” repeated Sidonie, in a
fever of excitement.</p>

<p>“This way, my girl, to the left. Walk down a little
way and you will hear his axe.”</p>

<p>Without even thanking him Sidonie started away,
resolved to find him before succumbing to her fatigue.
If she only could see Jean and tell her story, then she
would not care what happened to herself. Bruno must
be saved! Soon she was rewarded by hearing the woodcutter’s
axe. Jean was wielding it. He was a powerful
man, and with one stroke at the heart of a giant
tree it trembled and presently yielded to his herculean
blows. Around him on all sides lay enormous trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Page 150]</span>
with interlacing branches. Each trunk which had
seemed slender and unpretentious in life, now, prone
on the ground, assumed larger proportions, like certain
men whose measurements while living cannot be casually
estimated. The snow made the progress of the
work going on around him difficult. Every tree was
covered with feathery layers, and the branches showed
fantastic formations of all sorts. The glare was
blinding.</p>

<p>Ready to fall with fatigue, Sidonie ran from one man
to another crying: “Where is L’Ours? Where is he?”</p>

<p>One of the choppers pointed to the spot where Jean,
with arms bare to the elbow, was striking his last blow
into the tottering tree.</p>

<p>Conscious only of the idea which for over two hours
had sustained her, Sidonie did not realize her danger.
She hastened toward Jean Manant with unsteady steps.
He did not recognize her as he cried: “Look out
there, will you? You will be killed!”</p>

<p>The large oak-tree, wavering for an instant, fell toward
Sidonie. Jean uttered a desperate cry. Bracing
himself against a broken trunk, he pushed with all his
might against the falling tree. His gigantic strength
deviated it from the course in which it started, and as
it crashed to the earth, a mass of twigs and splinters
was showered around. Sidonie had not been conscious
of her peril, so centred were her thoughts upon the man
whom it was her dream to save.</p>

<p>“L’Ours! Bruno!” she gasped, and fainted at his
feet.</p>

<p>Jean heard but the last exclamation.</p>

<p>The blood mounted to his head and perspiration broke
out on his forehead. After recognizing Sidonie he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Page 151]</span>
knew at once that something had happened to Bruno.
He must be in danger. But of what?</p>

<p>Sidonie remained inanimate upon the ground. Unused
to seeing people in fainting spells, he knew not
what to do.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he thought, “cognac will revive her.”</p>

<p>He put his flask to Sidonie’s lips and soon afterward
she opened her eyes. Then Jean eagerly began to
question her.</p>

<p>“He is accused of murder. Murder, Jean! But he
is innocent.”</p>

<p>“Who accuses him?”</p>

<p>“<i>Mon Dieu!</i>” she cried, “he accuses himself.”</p>

<p>“What!” thundered Jean, picking up his coat.</p>

<p>“He will save him,” Sidonie joyously murmured.</p>

<p>“Get up and follow me,” he demanded, tersely.</p>

<p>With an effort she struggled to her feet, and he led
her toward the village. At the entrance to the little
street stood a picturesque cottage ingeniously made of
twisted roots. It was Jean’s own handiwork, and he
lived very happily in this snug habitation.</p>

<p>Before he entered the house Sidonie said: “You are
going to St. Benoit, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied.</p>

<p>On entering the house he shouted: “Wife, warm
up something for the little one. She is Bruno’s best
friend.”</p>

<p>“Say not so, Jean, say not so.”</p>

<p>“Why, you love him, do you not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, if—but——”</p>

<p>“I owe him a favor. And I will save him if I can.
You eat something, change your clothing, and then we
will start.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Page 152]</span></p>

<p>He had seen the condition of her garments, and out
of solicitude for her had suggested that she discard
them for dry ones.</p>

<p>“But why should I change my clothing? At the end
of a quarter of an hour I shall be as wet as ever.”</p>

<p>“No. You will see. But we must not waste time.
Make haste, child.—Wife, give her some dry clothing.”</p>

<p>Sidonie submitted. Jean’s wife, a bright, alert little
woman, with large brown eyes and a delicate skin, contrasted
strongly with her husband. “Beauty and the
Beast” people called them. Jeanne appeared surprisingly
happy. There was not a wrinkle on her brow,
and her frank, honest eyes and smiling, tender mouth
spoke well for her husband’s love and care.</p>

<p>After donning some warm, dry clothing Sidonie ate
with a keen relish the homely little repast Jeanne had
prepared, for nothing had she eaten since morning.</p>

<p>“Now I am going to fix your feet, little one, so you
can walk comfortably,” said Jean, when she had finished.</p>

<p>Then he carefully bound up her bruised and bleeding
feet in soft linen rags, and Jeanne brought out a pair of
soft woollen stockings and rubbers of her own as further
expedients of relief. Now, warm and carefully protected
against the dampness, the little lame girl regained
her fortitude and good spirits, and the reaction gave
fresh vigor to her weary limbs.</p>

<p>“Now come, my child,” said he, as he put on his
coat. After tenderly embracing his wife, he took
Sidonie’s hand in his and together they started for St.
Benoit. As they walked along Sidonie acquainted him
with the facts of the case as well as she was able.</p>

<p>“Yes, I agree with you, little one. It surely was not
Bruno who killed Savin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Page 153]</span></p>

<p>“When I saw he had determined to criminate himself,
I was perfectly willing to die,” said Sidonie, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“Poor child, I understand,” replied Jean, consolingly.</p>

<p>“It was Jeannille Marselon who thought of <i>you</i> first.”</p>

<p>“Jeannille Marselon!”</p>

<p>“Yes. She said to me: ‘Go and find L’Ours,
child.’”</p>

<p>“Brave woman! For once in her life she spoke
well.”</p>

<p>“And so I came. I remembered your love for
Bruno, and knew you would help him if anybody would.
And you <i>will</i> save him, dear, good Jean, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He shall not go to prison.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jean, how good you are!”</p>

<p>“No, no, child. It is he that is good and noble.
Listen. No one knows why I would die for Bruno. But
I am going to tell <i>you</i>, because you appreciate his
worth.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, tell me.”</p>

<p>“Well, listen. Five years ago at the Rouvray fair,
while passing the ox-stalls, I received a terrible blow
from the horn of a cow, on the face. I was badly hurt
and in a sorry plight, when Monsieur Morris the doctor,
passing by told me I must have the wound dressed.
I made light of it, but the doctor seized my arm and
drew me into a little cottage, the nearest one from the
spot where we were standing. It was terribly hot
weather. You remember—in ’81.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I remember.”</p>

<p>“As I said before, he took me by the arm and led me
in. A widow and her daughter occupied the cottage.
The latter gave me a drink of cold water, and from that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Page 154]</span>
moment I was not conscious what the doctor was doing
to my face. I was too much in love with the pretty
young woman to mind what he did. I watched her
come and go, and my heart was hers from that moment.
You can guess who it was. Yes, it was Jeanne, God
bless her!”</p>

<p>Sidonie gave a little gasp. Jean did not realize that
he was taking long strides and that the little lame girl
was desperately trying to keep up with him. L’Ours
continued, not noticing her discomfort:</p>

<p>“I said to myself, ‘God never made such a beautiful
creature to be mated with a man like me.’ When the
doctor had finished I thanked everybody—first Monsieur
Morris, then the widow, and finally Jeanne. She smiled
at me, but I was so stupid I knew not what I said.
But she answered sweetly, and then I went away.”</p>

<p>“Jean, I cannot walk so fast,” interrupted Sidonie.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, little one. I forget.”</p>

<p>He stopped a moment for Sidonie to rest, and then
they started on.</p>

<p>“I never remembered having seen such eyes as hers
before, and such a pretty mouth, dainty figure, and
glossy hair. Well, when I went out I forgot all about
the fair and returned to the woods.”</p>

<p>Thoroughly exhausted, Sidonie said: “L’Ours, leave
me here. I can go no farther.”</p>

<p>“Why, little one?”</p>

<p>“You must go on to St. Benoit to save Bruno, and I
can only hinder you. I cannot walk.”</p>

<p>“Lean against my arm, child, and you can go better.
We are just half way now. Keep up your courage,
child, I cannot leave you here.”</p>

<p>They again started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Page 155]</span></p>

<p>“Once alone, I dreamed of her at will. I was mad
with love.”</p>

<p>“Poor Jean! Yes, it is terrible.”</p>

<p>“You know—yes. I shall do for you what he did
for me.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Was I dreaming or waking, her face haunted me.
I lost strength. I could not eat or sleep, and for a year
I suffered in silence. Sometimes in the winter, in spite
of cold and snow, I would set out for Rouvray. I would
watch her window, and when the light was extinguished
I would walk back four miles, rewarded by having seen
her shadow on the curtain. One night I met Fadard.”</p>

<p>“Jean, good Jean, I cannot go any farther. My feet
are sinking from under me. Leave me.”</p>

<p>“What! Leave you here? Oh, no! Would you die
in the snow?”</p>

<p>“It would not matter.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be foolish. I dreamed of dying once, too, but
Jeanne saved me.”</p>

<p>Sidonie had stumbled upon a stick, and Jean now
stooped down and lifted her upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Jean? You will be worn out
and delayed if you carry me.”</p>

<p>“You are like a bird, little one. Have no fear. We
will go faster now.”</p>

<p>“Finish your story, Jean,” she requested at last.</p>

<p>“Well, time went on, and still I suffered. Bruno
noticed it finally, and asked me the trouble—Bruno,
who had come to me with all his little troubles. Like a
fool, I began to cry. My heart was full and I told him
all. The following day he went away on foot to Rouvray,
and he saw Jeanne and her mother. I do not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Page 156]</span>
what he said, but a week later he brought us together.
I could only look at her, with wide open eyes. It was
Jeanne who first spoke. She told me it would not be so
disagreeable to be my wife—she so pretty, so dainty, so
winning, and I so ugly, uncouth, and boorish. Well, I
asked her if she could really love me—and in three
months we were married. And I am so happy! so happy!
And, Sidonie, my wife—ah, she loves me—ugly
and clumsy as I am; and it is to Bruno, who brought it
about, that I owe my happiness. Bruno! Yes, I would
lay down my life for him. I owe him everything.”</p>

<p>Jean would have continued, but Sidonie, exhausted
and benumbed with cold, had fallen asleep in his arms.</p>

		CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
		<small>L’OURS.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>At three o’clock the officers, prisoners, and onlookers
arrived at St. Benoit, and the examination soon commenced.
It was his first criminal case, and the magistrate
began proceedings by questioning everybody right
and left in regard to the affair. Jacques Percier related
the walnut grove incident. Mademoiselle Faillot was
asked her opinion of the mystery, and Andoche was interrogated.</p>

<p>“It is as clear as day,” said the magistrate. The two
prisoners were then closely questioned. Bruno confessed
that he was guilty of the crime, and Catherine
did not deny the statement.</p>

<p>“Nothing plainer,” said the magistrate, at last, to the
justice.</p>

<p>“Permit me to say that one thing mystifies me,” returned
the justice. “More than one-half the peasants
declare the young man innocent.”</p>

<p>“Just so, my dear justice. But nevertheless he is
guilty.”</p>

<p>“And the gamekeeper’s wife herself has intimated
that we must not believe him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that. But she is driven to an extremity
by her love for the unfortunate fellow. That is the
most interesting part of the affair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Page 158]</span></p>

<p>“But, on the other hand, Bruno declares that Madame
Barrau knows nothing that he did.”</p>

<p>“Of course. They are bent on shielding each other.
That proves they are both guilty. Well, we must take
them to Avallon.—Banastre, will you see to the conveyance?
What time is it now?”</p>

<p>He consulted his watch.</p>

<p>“Ten minutes of four. We must be off in half an
hour.”</p>

<p>Banastre went in quest of a vehicle for the prisoners,
and the others waited for further developments.</p>

<p>Andoche wondered why the officers did not visit the
scene of the murder, and so expressed himself.</p>

<p>“Well, what would they see?” disagreed old Mathieu.
“The snow has enveloped everything.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later the conveyance was ready, and
Banastre entered the court-room with handcuffs. Those
who happened to look at Jeannille Marselon at that
moment saw a strange agitation written on her features.
On seeing the manacles Bruno made a gesture of revolt.
The exclamation, “I am innocent,” rose to his
lips. Jeannille regarded him with a troubled expression.
Then she gazed toward the road leading to Vaumarin,
her long fingers moved convulsively. Nervously she
directed her steps toward Andoche, the blacksmith.</p>

<p>“I wish to speak to the justice,” she said, simply.</p>

<p>For more than a year Jeannille had not addressed a living
person, save Sidonie. Her remark created a sensation.</p>

<p>“Jeannille wants to speak, Jeannille wants to speak,”
all cried in concert. Every one eagerly awaited her
next words. She must have something decisive to say
or she would not open her mouth, they reasoned.</p>

<p>Andoche whispered to the young magistrate, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Page 159]</span>
then Monsieur Bérard explained that “Aunt” Jeannille
was a strange woman, who had not spoken aloud for
months. Out of curiosity the magistrate decided to let
her speak.</p>

<p>“You have something of importance to communicate,”
he said to her.</p>

<p>Jeannille looked at him for a moment and then
turned her face toward the forest.</p>

<p>“Here comes Jean—L’Ours,” she said.</p>

<p>For a moment they thought she must be mad. But
every one was curious. Half the inhabitants of the
town, at least, were willing to believe that L’Ours must
have been born for the sole purpose of saving Bruno
from peril. Consequently to them the arrival of Jean
Manant meant but one thing—Bruno should be saved.</p>

<p>A few moments previous to his emerging from the
forest L’Ours had awakened Sidonie, and she, now
entirely rested, had urged him to go on and let her
follow slowly. This he did, and with giant strides he
soon came in sight of the conveyance all ready to take
to Avallon Bruno, who stood on the doorstep in custody
of a gendarme, with an excited crowd around him. In
another moment he stood beside Monsieur Bérard, to
whom he said: “You must not imprison that man!”</p>

<p>“Why? What have you to say about it?”</p>

<p>“I come to prove to you that Bruno is innocent of
this crime, and I am convinced that you will set him at
liberty.”</p>

<p>The aspect of Jean Manant was not calculated to
gain confidence. His dark, swarthy skin, keen black
eyes, and brawny arms did not fascinate the average
person. And the magistrate was not prepossessed in
his favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Page 160]</span></p>

<p>“Listen,” said L’Ours. “I am not here to make
trouble. But I must defend young Bruno. Neither
you nor your gendarmes can take him away if I say he
shall not go.”</p>

<p>“Insolent——”</p>

<p>“No, I am not insolent, Monsieur. It is the truth.
Ask anybody here. Ask Andoche, for instance.”</p>

<p>Andoche, leaning toward Monsieur Bérard, said: “A
blow from his fist would prostrate any man here. No
one would dare stand up against him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; but what are his intentions?”</p>

<p>“We shall see presently.”</p>

<p>Not considering it necessary to discuss with the
justice, L’Ours now turned to Bruno, and putting his
hand on the latter’s shoulder, said: “Do you pretend
that you killed the gamekeeper?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it was I,” replied Bruno, this time less resolutely.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, you are lying—that is all.”</p>

<p>“Jean! Leave me!” gasped Bruno.</p>

<p>“No, I will not leave you.” Then to the officers
he added: “Messieurs, it will be worth your while to
listen to me.”</p>

<p>“Gendarmes, we must enforce the law.”</p>

<p>L’Ours cast upon the young magistrate a look of
contempt, but the gendarmes came forward.</p>

<p>“Ah, pardon me! You refuse, then. Very well.”</p>

<p>And he assumed a fearlessly defensive attitude.</p>

<p>“But no!” he exclaimed, an instant afterward.
“You represent justice. Then <i>be</i> just. Your duty is
to listen. If you refuse to do so, there is no justice in
you.”</p>

<p>“Jean,” interrupted Bruno, “I pray you, be silent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Page 161]</span></p>

<p>“Anything but that, my son. You must hear me
speak. I ask only five minutes.”</p>

<p>Bruno did not know what Jean meant to say, but he
shared in the belief that Jean would save him in spite
of himself. He feared that Jean would throw all the
responsibility of the crime on Catherine’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“Bruno pretends that he assassinated Monsieur
Barrau last night,” pursued Jean Manant.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” broke in Bruno, testily.</p>

<p>“Well, then let him reply to three questions that I
shall put. At what hour did he commit the crime?”</p>

<p>“At five o’clock in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Very well. With what weapon?”</p>

<p>“With my gun, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Very well. In what part of the wood?”</p>

<p>At this question Bruno hesitated. He but vaguely
knew from hearsay the spot where Savin had fallen.
But, as we have seen, neither he nor any one else but
Andoche could have said positively where the crime had
been committed. Bruno, who had supposed that merely
his confession would be sufficient, did not know at
first what to reply. But he did not dare to hesitate
long.</p>

<p>“About two hundred feet from here,” he said, with
affected calmness.</p>

<p>“You must lead us to the spot.”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” assented the magistrate. “Yes, you
must conduct us there.”</p>

<p>The officers had not bothered about going to the spot
because the dying man had been found on his own doorsteps.
And in this respect they had erred. Everybody
at first had regarded Firmin as the assassin, but
after Bruno’s confession they concluded that they must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Page 162]</span>
have been mistaken. Jean’s questions, however, again
shifted the evidence from Bruno to Firmin. Among a
few the suspicion occurred that L’Ours had asked Bruno
to point out the place in the wood in order to save him.
Once in the depths of the forest, he might easily find
means to free Bruno from his captors and hide him in
safety.</p>

<p>Bruno, resolved not to betray any embarrassment or
confusion, answered that he would conduct them to the
spot. Thereupon he started for the wood, followed by
all, and when he had reached the fork in the road he
quickly turned down the path to the right. At this
juncture Andoche tapped him on the shoulder, saying:
“You need go no farther, Bruno: you are not the man
who did this deed.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then you are convinced?” said L’Ours.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Bruno, with a
ferocious scowl.</p>

<p>“This morning, Monsieur Bérard, when you questioned
me,” went on the blacksmith, “I told you that I
knew nothing. But now I can affirm that Bruno did
not kill Monsieur Savin.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he does not know where the crime was
committed.”</p>

<p>“And do you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“This morning after reaching here I followed the
traces of blood from Savin’s wound, and finally I came
to the place where he received the fatal shot.”</p>

<p>“Andoche speaks in this manner,” sneered Bruno,
“because the snow now has obliterated all marks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Page 163]</span></p>

<p>“Well, show us the spot where the bullet was fired,”
said Jean Manant.</p>

<p>Going about twenty paces farther, at random, Bruno
stopped.</p>

<p>“Here is the spot,” he boldly asserted.</p>

<p>“What stupidity,” muttered Léocadia Faillot to herself.
“Why can’t they believe a man when he declares
himself guilty? What a set of dunces! If I were the
justice, do you think I would listen to that bear of a
Manant or that soak of an Andoche?”</p>

<p>“My child,” said a deep voice behind her, “don’t be
so positive of that.”</p>

<p>It was Jeannille Marselon who spoke, and this was
the third time she had opened her mouth to-day. Léocadia
answered her with an insolent smile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bruno was requested to recount the circumstances
of the murder. Then in truth he faltered,
realizing how difficult it was to pass himself off for an
assassin. So many wretched beings find it impossible
to prove their innocence; and behold, here was a man
vainly endeavoring to prove his guilt!</p>

<p>“It would be far easier, my boy, to establish your
innocence,” said Jean Manant, ironically.</p>

<p>“Leave me, L’Ours,” returned Bruno, with vehemence.
“Do not trouble me any more. Do you think I
find it an agreeable duty to confess myself a criminal?”</p>

<p>“You are no criminal.—Am I not right, Sidonie?”</p>

<p>The little cripple answered with a sigh. Her tears
made a greater impression upon Bruno than had all the
preceding objurgations. The evidence that he was
causing her torment, as well as the thought that she
was wasting her love on him, stung his feelings. He
who could not see a woman or child in danger without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Page 164]</span>
rushing to the rescue was now moved by the poor girl’s
sorrow. But he soon rallied, and turning he said: “I
stood here, and the keeper came from that direction. I
took aim——”</p>

<p>Here he paused. Courage failed him. If they had
accepted his word and taken him to prison, all would
have been well. But to rack his brains to prove his
guilt, that was another matter. To devise an infamous
scheme to criminate himself before his friends as well
as his enemies, that was too much. Speech deserted
him.</p>

<p>“Come,” said L’Ours, “you do not know how to finish.—Monsieur
Bérard, send a gendarme for Bruno’s gun,
and you will see that it did not serve him last night.”</p>

<p>Plagnolles was despatched on the errand. L’Ours
turned to the blacksmith.</p>

<p>“Andoche, you will show us where the crime was
committed. Come, let us see.”</p>

<p>Whereat the young magistrate exclaimed: “Who is
conducting these proceedings?”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I command no one. Andoche is a friend.
I ask him to show me the place.”</p>

<p>“Well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are not obliged to come with us. But there
is no law to prevent me from going.”</p>

<p>The young magistrate could see that he was losing
ground. The case was slipping out of his hands. Besides,
L’Ours exerted an influence over the peasants
around him. Upon first seeing him they became confident
that he would save his <i>protégé</i>. And matters had
so developed that he had nearly gained his point.
Nearly everybody regarded Jean Manant with a mingled
feeling of fear and admiration. He was the soul of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Page 165]</span>
justice, and he played a noble part in probing the crime
to the depths. Taking Andoche’s arm he begged him to
come. The blacksmith led him down the path to the
left of the fork in the road, and then about four hundred
yards into the forest. There he pointed out the broken
and hanging branches which he had discovered in the
morning.</p>

<p>“Certainly it is now easy to perceive how the deed was
done,” said L’Ours. “The gamekeeper approached
from the right, and the assassin stood here——”</p>

<p>Jean in his enthusiasm leaped upon a little snow-bank,
as he supposed, but his foot struck against something
hard and he slipped. At the same instant a groan as it
were from the bowels of the earth was heard. This created
a terrible commotion, and some of the spectators in
their fear made the sign of the cross. While the others
were betraying their alarm, Andoche leaned over the
place where the sound was heard. He and Jean together
pushed away the snow, and a terrible sight met
their gaze. There lay extended upon the ground a man,
cold and rigid; while lying on his chest was a huge
dog that held him by the throat, his teeth fastened on
each side of the windpipe. The strangled man evidently
had struggled to free himself, but failing in this
he had concentrated his forces in a terrible embrace to
throttle his enemy. But the dog was not a coward,
and he had preferred to die rather than leave his master
unavenged. For the dog was Savin’s brave Patachaud.</p>

<p>The man whom he had killed had not relaxed his
hold, and the courageous beast was nearly choked when
L’Ours providentially stepped upon the snow-bank.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” cried Sidonie. “Tell us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Page 166]</span></p>

<p>“It is clear that Patachaud has defended his master,
and that the dead man was the murderer.”</p>

<p>Andoche tried to cover the dead man’s face, but he
was too late. Léocadia Faillot uttered a cry.</p>

<p>It was Fadard.</p>

<p>A profound, stifling silence ensued. All felt that it
was the duty of the magistrate to draw deductions.
Finally he spoke.</p>

<p>“Is this not the man we questioned this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur. It is Fadard.”</p>

<p>“He must, then, be the assassin.”</p>

<p>“No!” cried Léocadia, “no, Monsieur. He is a relative
of mine. I know him intimately.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, the gamekeeper’s dog has choked him
to death, to avenge his master.”</p>

<p>“The keeper’s dog,” ranted the woman, “was mad,
and threw himself at the neck of my cousin, who was
the first person the cur happened to meet.”</p>

<p>While Léocadia was speaking the released Patachaud,
once more on his feet, made for the house of his master
at a limping pace.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Faillot continued to defend Fadard with
violent energy. With a savage movement she pushed
away the blacksmith, and falling on her knees beside the
dead man lifted his head on her lap and called him tenderly
by name. Every one was astounded at her affectionate
demonstrations. A strange tenderness was to
be detected in her voice and manner, foreign to Léocadia’s
character.</p>

<p>“I am sorry it gives you pain, Mademoiselle,” said
Jean Manant, “but he is Monsieur Barrau’s murderer.”</p>

<p>“I tell you he is not,” cried the grief-stricken woman,
facing Jean with a glare of hatred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Page 167]</span></p>

<p>“I have my revenge sooner than I expected,” said
Sidonie, inaudibly.</p>

<p>“The dog <i>must</i> have been mad. My poor Cyprien!
And then to have killed Savin, he must have had a
weapon,” continued Léocadia. “He had no gun, you
see.”</p>

<p>“We must prove that,” said L’Ours. They hunted
around in the snow and soon produced a Lefancheux
rifle.</p>

<p>“But that is Barrau’s,” urged Mademoiselle Faillot.</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said Jean, again making a search, this
time assisted by Banastre among others.</p>

<p>Sidonie was triumphant, and Bruno now dared to hope
that Catherine’s innocence would be established as well
as his own. Tears of joy sprang to his eyes. All were
now searching for the weapon through which Barrau
had lost his life. Presently the gendarme Plagnolles
returned with Bruno’s gun. It was a primitive weapon,
both as to appearance and use, and under the breech
the copper cap was covered with verdigris. It was not
necessary for a man to be a <i>connoisseur</i> to observe
that this weapon had been idle for more than a
month.</p>

<p>“The young man has deceived us,” said the magistrate.
“This gun has not been used recently.”</p>

<p>“Ah, here it is,” exclaimed Jean Manant, at this juncture,
bringing to light another rifle. This was not so
old as Bruno’s, but there was nothing modern about it.
Jean Manant quickly detected that one of the cartridges
was missing. It became more and more evident that Fadard
was the guilty man.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Morris extracted the lead from poor Barrau’s
chest, this morning,” said Sidonie. “Let us compare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Page 168]</span>
its size with that of the cartridges in the gun just
found.”</p>

<p>“A good notion, little one,” said Jean, suiting the
action to the word. The bullet taken from Savin’s
body exactly fitted the cartridge in the barrel of
Fadard’s rifle, and his guilt was now fully established.</p>

<p>Léocadia alone attempted to explain the case differently.</p>

<p>“But Savin Barrau forced Firmin to fight with him.
Why may he not have pushed Fadard to the wall and
made him fire in self-defence?”</p>

<p>“Impossible! Savin was close to the muzzle of the
gun that shot him.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Faillot reflected for a moment and then
scrutinized the oak-tree which had been slightly blazed
by the shot.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, but between the point where my cousin
stood and this spot there must have been quite a
distance. It was dark. The two adversaries may
have found themselves all at once in close proximity,
and Savin may have hidden behind the bushes.
Then——”</p>

<p>As she spoke she shook the tree with a feverish hand,
and the snow fluttered down, revealing at the fork of
one of the branches a bit of half-burned paper. The
magistrate stepped forward and took it.</p>

<p>“It is the other wad,” said Andoche. “See, it exactly
corresponds with the one I just took out.”</p>

<p>All was now conclusively proven. The magistrate
handed Andoche the two wads, who in turn gave them
to Jean Manant to adjust, when Rosalie, who was looking
over his shoulder, remarked that the two fragments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Page 169]</span>
of paper looked like parts of a letter, and that the handwriting
was Léocadia’s.</p>

<p>“Look! There near the burned part it is signed.”</p>

<p>Jean could not resist the temptation to look. Léocadia,
having heard Rosalie’s remark, advanced to seize
the paper; but Jean, divining her intention, quickly
turned it over to the magistrate.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” he said, “this paper should be seen by
you.”</p>

<p>After silently perusing the scrap, the magistrate
turned to the wretched woman.</p>

<p>“This man,” said he, pointing to Fadard’s body,
“was then your son.”</p>

<p>Léocadia gave one cry of baffled rage, as she stared
at the mocking faces of the crowd around her. The
reason for her persistent defence was now understood,
and her grief was indeed unfeigned.</p>

<p>When it became known that Léocadia was the mother
of Fadard, there was great excitement in St. Benoit.
She had posed long as a virtuous woman, and always
had been the first to cast a stone at her fallen sisters.
And now to know that she was a <i>declassée</i> piqued their
dull faculties of discernment. Some in their spite seized
stones and would have hurled them at her, had not compassion
for her grief deterred them. After all, she
manifested the possession of a mother’s heart in her
bosom. That was, perhaps, her only virtue. And as
she prostrated herself by the side of her dead son,
they turned away, silent in the presence of such
anguish.</p>

<p>On the way back to the cottage traces of blood were
found here and there.</p>

<p>“Madame Catherine is innocent at last,” cried Bruno,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Page 170]</span>
unable longer to restrain himself, as they neared the
house. “Thank God! she is innocent.”</p>

<p>Sidonie heard these words and staggered as though
struck to the heart. No word of gratitude for her
noble effort to save him crossed his lips. His one
thought was for Catherine.</p>

		CHAPTER XIX.<br>
		<small>CATHERINE’S LAST WORDS.</small>
	</h2>
</div>

<p>Forty-eight hours later the gamekeeper was buried.
L’Ours, leaving the cemetery with Sidonie, passed the
cottage of Mother Mathurine.</p>

<p>“Bruno,” said he, stopping at the gate, “Madame
Catherine wishes to see you.”</p>

<p>“Me?” asked Bruno, turning pale.</p>

<p>Sidonie visibly trembled as, noticing his expression,
she inwardly said: “How he loves her!”</p>

<p>“What does she want of me?” demanded Bruno,
with glowing face, when he had recovered his self-possession.</p>

<p>A wild dream that she, now being free, could love
him filled his heart with rapture.</p>

<p>“She wishes to do what is right,” replied Jean, “and
has a word to say to you.”</p>

<p>“Must I go at once?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am ready.”</p>

<p>“Come, little one. You must accompany us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Why should I go?”</p>

<p>“Because she wishes to speak to you, too.”</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour afterward the three entered
Catherine’s presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Page 172]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks, Jean, for bringing them here; and you, my
young friends, I thank you for coming.”</p>

<p>“Now I must go,” said Jean. “Good-by—all.”</p>

<p>He opened the door, and Sidonie watched him
anxiously as he departed.</p>

<p>Catherine asked them to be seated.</p>

<p>She was no longer the charming, gracious woman
they had known. Two days of sorrow and shame and
remorse had changed her into a sad-eyed woman, and
every feature betrayed the suffering she had undergone.
She extended her hand to little Sidonie.</p>

<p>“You love Bruno, little one, do you not? Tell me
frankly.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured Sidonie, hiding her blushing face.</p>

<p>“Then, my children, you must be married. My
shadow must not stand between you.”</p>

<p>Bruno quickly rose.</p>

<p>“No, no, Madame. If I were to marry, I should choose
Sidonie. But I shall never marry.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You know the reason, Madame.”</p>

<p>“Because of your love for me?”</p>

<p>Bruno was silent.</p>

<p>“You are wrong. A strange infatuation has governed
you, which time and our brave little Sidonie will
cure. At heart I am responsible for my husband’s
death, because I wished it, and I even suggested to two
men the idea of avenging me. One of those men was
Firmin; the other was you, Bruno.”</p>

<p>Bruno here made an impatient gesture, as though to
silence her. But she continued in a low tone: “You see,
it was not for the sake of friendship, but to be revenged.
But I did not deceive you. You thought me guilty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Page 173]</span></p>

<p>Bruno again tried to quiet her.</p>

<p>“Do not deny it, Bruno. When you confessed the
crime it was to shield me, for you believed me guilty.
And so I was in intent, though I did not perform the
deed. All night I waited expecting to hear the shot
which should make me free. At last it came. And oh,
the agony of that moment!”</p>

<p>A profound stillness supervened. Sidonie, with tearful
eyes, gazed at Catherine. Bruno was deeply affected
as he saw the once beautiful woman torn with grief and
remorse. In gasps she told them of the horrible night
she had passed; of the bloody fingers that seemed always
to clasp her cheek; of the ghastly discovery at early
dawn. All this she told them without trying to palliate
her part in it. Her suffering was pitiful.</p>

<p>“God knows how penitent I am, and to him alone
can I turn in my anguish and wickedness. Every
moment those bloody fingers seem burning into my
flesh. That is my just punishment. It will follow me
wherever I go. I cannot escape. The blood of my
innocent husband will be forever on my head. My
hands will wear the crimson stain so long as I live. My
cheek will always bear the marks of bloody fingers.
My poor Savin’s legacy to me is a legacy of blood!”</p>

<p>She paused in a paroxysm of passion.</p>

<p>“And now, Bruno, you understand why I bid you to
marry our little Sidonie. She will make you happy.
She is worthy of your love.—And when you are his wife,
little one, remember and profit by my experience. When
I am gone——”</p>

<p>“Oh, do not speak in that way!” protested Sidonie.</p>

<p>“Child, I am going away from here—far away from
the frightful spot of my crime. I love my husband—too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Page 174]</span>
late, yes; but his memory shall be sacred to me
even unto death. And now, before I go, let me feel
that you two will be happy. You, my child, will be a
true wife to him; but if you are ever inclined to test his
love and jealousy, think of me, and be warned in time.”</p>

<p>“Fear not. Coquetry is not to my taste,” said the
little cripple, sadly.</p>

<p>Bruno took her hand, and a smile of perfect love
illumined her face.</p>

<p>Together they went away.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p>The following morning, upon going to the corner of
the wood, two peasants found the Barrau cottage deserted.
Under cover of the night, Catherine, true to her
word, had silently stolen away. No traces of her were
ever found, and to this day the people of St. Benoit
speak in mysterious tones of her disappearance, and
with an air of superstitious gravity tell the story of the
gamekeeper’s murder.</p>

<p>At twenty-three a broken heart may heal, and one
day in the springtime a pleasant little wedding <i>fête</i> was
given in honor of Sidonie and her devoted Bruno.</p>

<p>Jeannille Marselon was present, and, though she did
not speak, for once her face brightened with interest
while she watched the lovelight shining in Bruno’s eyes
as he bent down to kiss the upturned face, and to stroke
the golden tresses of his fair young bride.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
